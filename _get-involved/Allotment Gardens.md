<p>Allotment gardens are common green spaces where aspiring gardeners can lease gardening plots to hone their skills and grow their own greens. They can be found in various parks, heartlands, private estates and even organisations.</p>
<p>Under NParks’ Allotment Gardening Scheme, each household may apply and ballot for one garden plot to grow herbs, vegetables or any other ornamental plants. These allotment gardens are located across 25 parks and gardens in Singapore. Each plot consists of a raised planter bed (2.5m x 1m) with soil and a mini storage area for tools and may be leased for a period of up to 3 years at a charge of <b>$57 per year</b> (excluding prevailing GST). </p> 


<p>More allotment gardens will be opened progressively in other parks in the future. In tandem, NParks is also actively facilitating garden space activation by working with partner agencies and grassroot organisations to introduce allotment gardens in heartland areas to enable more people to garden closer to where they live. To support these efforts, NParks also published ‘<a href="https://go.gov.sg/guide-to-design-allotment-gardens">A Guide to Designing and Implementing Allotment Gardens</a> which is free-of-charge (click to download).</p>
