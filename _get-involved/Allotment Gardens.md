<p>Allotment gardens are common green spaces where aspiring gardeners can lease gardening plots to hone their skills and grow their own greens. They can be found in various parks, heartlands, private estates and even organisations.</p>

<p>There are now close to 2,200 allotment garden plots across 25 parks and gardens in Singapore. Check out the map below to locate an allotment garden in our parklands near you!</p>

<p>NParks will be progressively introducing more plots in various parks across Singapore, and work closely with agencies, Town Councils and Grassroots Organisations to implement more allotment gardens in areas outside of parklands to enable more people to garden closer to where they live. To support these efforts, NParks has also published ‘<a href="https://go.gov.sg/guide-to-design-allotment-gardens">A Guide to Designing and Implementing Allotment Gardens</a>' which is free for all to download.</p>

<h4>About the Allotment Gardening Scheme</h4>

<p>Under NParks’ Allotment Gardening Scheme, each household may apply and ballot for one garden plot at any one location at a time. Each plot consists of a raised planter bed (2.5m x 1m) with soil and a mini storage area for tools and may be leased for a period of up to 3 years at a charge of <b>$57 per year</b> (excluding prevailing GST). </p>
