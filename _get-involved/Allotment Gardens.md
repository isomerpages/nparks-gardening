<p>NParks will be progressively introducing more plots in various parks across Singapore, and work closely with agencies, Town Councils and Grassroots Organisations to implement more allotment gardens in areas outside of parklands to enable more people to garden closer to where they live. To support these efforts, NParks has also published ‘<a href="https://go.gov.sg/guide-to-design-allotment-gardens">A Guide to Designing and Implementing Allotment Gardens</a>' which is free for all to download.</p>

<h4>About the Allotment Gardening Scheme</h4>

<p>Under NParks’ Allotment Gardening Scheme, each household may apply and ballot for one garden plot at any one location at a time. Each plot consists of a raised planter bed (2.5m x 1m) with soil and a mini storage area for tools and may be leased for a period of up to 3 years at a charge of <b>$57 per year</b> (excluding prevailing GST). </p>

				<summary>1. What is an allotment garden?</summary>
				Allotment gardens are areas located within parks and gardens that house gardening plots available for lease to the community to grow their own plants. With most of the population living in high-rise flats with minimalspace for gardening within their household footprint, these allotment garden plots provide them with further opportunities to garden. To date, more than 2000 allotment garden plots have been made available to the community with plans for further expansion. In tandem, NParks is working with Town Councils and Grassroot Organisations to provide advice on setting up of allotment gardens in public housing estates so that residents can garden closer to their homes. <br><br>

		<summary>3. Can I plant anything that I like?</summary>
		All plants and gardening structures should not exceed 1 metre in standing height (measured from soil level in the planter bed). Gardeners are advised not to plant poisonous plants or those with sap as these plants can cause discomfort and are harmful to the public. Plants that are illegal are not allowed to be planted. 
		<br>Please also be mindful of the neighbouring plots when planting up your mini garden and ensure that your plants do not encroach into their space. Keep your space clean and tidy for the safety of all your fellow allotment gardeners.<br><br>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary>4. Can I use pesticides at the allotment garden plot?</summary>
		Chemical pesticides, herbicides and fungicides are not allowed to be used at the allotment garden plots as they may kill insects, such as bees and wasps, which play an important role in the pollination process of flowering plants. Such chemicals may also spread to other plots and may cause adverse reactions to gardeners tending to other plots or public who visit the plots. <br><br>
