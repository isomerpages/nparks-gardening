<p>This year marks the 20th anniversary of the <a href="/get-involved/community-gardens/">Community in Bloom (CIB) programme</a>. As part of the celebrations, the community can look forward to a host of activities at community gardens islandwide throughout the year with the new <a href="/grow-and-share-initiative/">'Grow and Share' initiative</a>. The celebrations will culminate at <a href="/hortfest-2025/">HortFest 2025</a> in August 2025, where members of public can find out more about the stories behind these gardens and how CIB volunteers have played a part in promoting community stewardship through their love for gardening over the last two decades. </p>

<p>Some of these stories are chronicled in our commemorative book titled 'Community in Bloom - Stories from our Community Gardens', depicting lasting friendships forged over the love of gardening and showcasing our community gardeners' efforts as stewards of nature.</p>
