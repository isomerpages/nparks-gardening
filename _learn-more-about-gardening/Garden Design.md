	<h4>Garden design steps</h4>
	<p>Here are some suggested steps on how to design a garden:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Gather your community, and assess their needs</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Gardeners may have varied interests, fitness levels, and horticultural know-how</li>
			<li>Listing down specific wants (e.g., a space to grow edible plants) and needs (e.g., a wheelchair-accessible path) will help with site selection and the final design.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Select a site</li>
		<ul> 
			<li>Gardens need sunlight, and ideally should be in an area with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">full sun</a> to maximise what can be grown. Areas with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">partial sun</a> can also work, but will have less planting choices. Areas in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">full shade</a> should be avoided entirely as plants will not be able to grow. </li>
			<li>Sites will need to be accessible to gardeners, and should ideally be near major walkways and existing pathways. These pathways should also be wheelchair- or trolley- accessible to make it easier to get to and from the garden.</li>
			<li>The site will need at least one <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/water-points/">water point</a>. Water point can usually be found near existing facilities like void decks, but if one is not available, communities will have to work with the landowner to build one.</li>
		</ul>
