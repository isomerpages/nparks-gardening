<p><strong><em>Other common names: Plant louse, Greenfly or Ant cow</em></strong></p>

<p>Aphids are sap-sucking insects that are small and pear-shaped. They come in various colors – green, yellow, brown-red or black and can be winged or wingless. Aphids have needle-like mouthparts that they use to pierce into the plant tissue to feed. They are usually found on plant stems and the undersides of leaves.</p>

<p>Aphids produce honeydew (a sweet fluid) as a waste product while feeding that ants love. Hence, ants may guard and care for aphids in return for food. Therefore, when you notice ants climbing around your plant, you may want to take closer look for the presence of aphids.</p>

<p>Aphids largely do not cause great damage when caught early. However, if they are left unattended for a period, aphids can infest and weaken the plant, causing stunted growth, fruit deformities or even death. They also spread many viral plant diseases as they travel plant to plant to reproduce.</p>

<p></p><h4>Symptoms:</h4><p></p>

<ul>
	<li>Infested leaves and stems tend to curl downwards.&nbsp;Developing fruits may also become distorted in shape.</li>
	<li>Leaves, stems and fruits appear sticky, and can become covered in sooty mould which is unsightly.</li>
</ul>

<p></p><h4>Preventive and control measures:</h4><p></p>

<p>Do regular checks on your plants for aphids, on the stems of the plant and underside of leaves, which may be distorted or curled.</p>

<p>Onion, garlic and chili spray can serve as a repellent to prevent aphids, as these aromatics contain compounds which help to deter pests.</p>

<p>When the population of aphids is still small, you may clean affected areas with a wet cloth.</p>

<p>Avoid the use of pesticide applications to encourage population growth of natural predators of aphids such as the Ladybirds, Lacewings, parasitic wasps, which will feed on aphids.</p>

<p>When a large part of your plant is affected, you may want to remove the affected area by using a clean secateur or consider removing the whole plant. Bag up the infested plant/plant parts for proper disposal to prevent further spread to the same plant and other nearby plants. Do not use the removed plant waste for composting.</p>
