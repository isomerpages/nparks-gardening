	<p><b>Wilting</b> is characterized by plants having limp and droopy stems and is usually a sign that the plant needs attention. While dramatic, wilting is a relatively easy problem to fix. Wilting is a natural response by plants to reduce water loss, and many plants can bounce back if the wilting is treated within a day or two. However, prolonged wilting can cause damage to stems, leaves and flowers, and may even result in death.</p>

	<h4>Symptoms</h4> 
	<p>Leaves will start to fold up and droop, and soft stems will bend over. Flowers may close and droop as well.</p>

	<h4>Treatment</h4>
	<p>Wilting is always a sign of water loss. Identifying the cause of water loss is important for treatment as they can be contradictory if the cause is misidentified. For example, more water will be needed if the wilting was caused by heat, but additional water will kill a wilting plant if the wilting was caused by root rot.</p>
  <p></p><ul>
	  <li><b>Wilting due to heat stress</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Prolonged dry periods and high temperatures are likely to cause wilting, especially for plants with soft leaves and stems like Thai Basil, Cai Xin, Lettuce and Cucumber.</li>
				<li>Water your plants more regularly during the dry period and consider adding mulch to the base of stems to reduce water loss.</li>
				<li>Consider moving your plants to a shadier area during particularly hot periods, if applicable.</li>
			</ul></li>
  	<li><b>Wilting due to root rot</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Lots of rain and overwatering can cause root rot, especially if the soil or pot does not drain well. Check your plantâ€™s roots for damage if it has been wilting despite regular watering.</li>
					<li>If root rot is present, cut off the rotting portions and change the soil to prevent additional rot. Check the drainage of your plot or pot to ensure that water can drain away. </li>
					<li>If the plant can be propagated by cuttings, consider propagating the healthy portions. </li>
				</ul></li>
