<section>
<h4 id="a">A</h4>
	<div id="annual"><b><u>Annual plants</u></b></div>
	Annual plants are plants that will die at the end of a growing season, and will need to be replanted or regrown. Tropical climates don't really have seasons, so in Singapore's context, annual plants are plants that will die within a year.
	<br><br><br>
</section>

<section>
<h4 id="b">B</h4>
	<div id="bacterial-ooze"><b><u>Bacterial ooze</u></b></div>
A liquid discharge coming out from a bacterial infected part of the plant.
	<br><br>
	<div id="biodiversity-attracting"><b><u>Biodiversity-attracting plants</u></b></div>
Plants that produce materials that attracts animals, like food or nesting materials. Food materials include nectar, pollen, and fruit, while nesting materials include hollow twigs, leaves for lining nests, or large branches. 
	<br><br>
		<div id="bud"><b><u>Bud</u></b></div>
Horticulturally, this refers to undeveloped shoots at the base of leaves or on the tip of stems. They can develop into flowers or additional stems. 
	<br><br><br>
</section>

<section>
<h4 id="c">C</h4>
	<div id="corm"><b><u>Corm</u></b></div>
	Corms are short, vertical, underground plant stems that store starch for plants. A number of them can be cooked and eaten, and they can also be used for propagation via division.
	<br><br>
		<div id="cultivar"><b><u>Cultivar</u></b></div>
	Cultivars are plant types that have been produced by breeding by people in cultivation, as opposed to being produced via natural selection in the wild. Many commercial plant cultivars have been bred to make them more appealing, with larger fruits, showier flowers, or resistance to heat or pests.

<section>
<h4 id="e">E</h4>
	<div id="establish"><b><u>Establish</u></b></div>
	Establishing refers to how plants stabilise after being transplanted, propagated, or pruned. Plants that are establishing are recovering, and will need more care to ensure that they bounce back. 
	<br><br><br>
</section>

<section>
<h4 id="f">F</h4>
	<div id="flower"><b><u>Flower</u></b></div>
	Flowers are the reproductive structure of a plant. The "male" parts or a flower  produce pollen, while "female" parts  consist of the stigma and ovule, which become fruits and seeds when pollen is brought to the stigma in a process called pollination. Plants can have flowers that are male, female, or both.
	<br><br>
	<div id="free-flowering"><b><u>Free-flowering</u></b></div>
	When flowering plants are described as free-flowering, they often have a long bloom time and do not have a defined blooming season. They produce many flowers continuously over a long period, sometimes all year round.
	<br><br><br>
</section>

<section>
<h4 id="g">G</h4>
	<div id="ground-cover"><b><u>Ground cover</u></b></div>
Ground Covers are plants that creep along the ground, growing horizontally and thus covering the ground. Ground covers can be used to protect soil, prevent erosion and serve as the lowest layer in mixed planting. 
	<br><br><br>
</section>

<section>
<h4 id="h">H</h4>
	<div id="heat-stress"><b><u>Heat stress</u></b></div>
Heat stress is defined as damage caused by an increase in temperature. This results in plants rapidly losing water through evaporation, and causes wilting, stunted growth, and if severe, death.

<h4 id="l">L</h4>
	<div id="leaf"><b><u>Leaf</u></b></div>
	Leaves are specialised plant parts grown above ground for photosynthesis. They are usually flat and green, but some plants can also have them in other shapes and colours, like how succulent leaves can range from pink to purple and have a more 3D shape. 
	<br><br>
		<div id="leggy"><b><u>Leggy</u></b></div>
Leggy plants are very tall with few leaves, and are usually etoilated or in need of pruning. 
	<br><br><br>

<section>
<h4 id="n">N</h4>
	<div id="nodes"><b><u>Nodes</u></b></div>
Nodeas are areas of a stem where buds are located, and are where new stems, leaves, flowers, or roots can form when exposed to different environmental factors. For example, a node that used to produce leaves can instead grow roots when submerged in water of soil, which is how plants are propagated from cuttings. 
	<br><br><br>
</section>

<section>
<h4 id="o">O</h4>
	<div id="offshoot"><b><u>Offshoot</u></b></div>
Offshoots are lateral shoots that are produced from the main stem of a plant, and can produce small plants at the end. They are also sometimes known as "pups" or "suckers", and can be divided from the mother plant to be propagated.  
	<br><br><br>
</section>

<section>
<h4 id="p">P</h4>
	<div id="perennial"><b><u>Perennial plants</u></b></div>
Perennial plants traditionally refer to plants that survive beyond one season. Tropical climates don't really have seasons, so in Singapore's context, perennial plants are plants that can survive beyond a year.
	<br><br>
	<div id="perimeter-plants"><b><u>Perimeter plants</u></b></div>
Perimeter plants are plants grown along the borders of a garden, and serve as demarcation to define the edge of a space. 
	<br><br>
	<div id="pollination"><b><u>Pollination</u></b></div>
Pollination refers to the transport of pollen to the stigma of a plant, which is key to the formation of fruit. Some plants can self-pollinate if the pollen and stigma are in the same flower, but plants with pollen and stigmas in separate flowers will need to be pollinated by wind, insects, or other means. 
	<br><br>
	<div id="propagation"><b><u>Propagation</u></b></div>
	Propagation is the process in which new plants can be grown from various plant parts. Most gardeners propagate plants via seeds, leaf cuttings, stem cuttings, or the division of offshoots, rhizomes, tubers, and corms. 
	<br><br><br>

<h4 id="r">R</h4>
	<div id="rhizome"><b><u>Rhizome</u></b></div>
	Rhizomes are underground plant stems that grow horizontally, and can continuously put out new roots and shoots from its nodes. Some rhizomes can store starch, and are edible. Rhizomes can be used for propagation via division. 
	<br><br>
	<div id="rooting-hormone"><b><u>Rooting hormone</u></b></div>
	Rooting hormones are substances that are used to stimulate root growth on cuttings. It usually comes as a powder, and can be bought in commercial nurseries. 
	<br><br><br>
</section>

<section>
<h4 id="s">S</h4>
	<div id="stem"><b><u>Stem</u></b></div>
	The main stalk of a plant, where leaves, flowers and fruits can grow from nodes.
	<br><br>
	<div id="solarisation"><b><u>Solarisation</u></b></div>
	A method of pest control for soil — done by covering the soil with a transparent plastic sheet during the hot season, heating the soil up by sun energy, thereby controlling soil-borne pests.
	<br><br>
	<div id="succulent"><b><u>Succulent</u></b></div>
	Parts of the plants that are thicken and fleshy to help retain water for plants that are in dry environments or soil conditions.
	<br><br>
	<div id="sucker"><b><u>Sucker</u></b></div>
Shoots that are produced from the main stem of a plant, and  can be divided from the mother plant to be propagated. Sometimes also known as "Offshoots".  
	<br><br><br>
</section>

<section>
<h4 id="t">T</h4>
	<div id="thinning"><b><u>Thinning</u></b></div>
Thinning is the act of removing plants, branches, or plant parts to create more space for remaining plants to grow. Thinning is an important part of maintenance for ground covers, seedlings, and young plants. 
	<br><br>
	<div id="tuber"><b><u>Tuber</u></b></div>
Tubers are large underground roots that contain starch and other nutrients for plants. Many tubers are edible, and can also be used for propagating plants via division. 
	<br><br>
	<div id="turgid"><b><u>Turgid</u></b></div>
	Turgid is a descriptive term referring to plant parts that are full of water, and are thus rigid. Healthy plants will have turgid stems and leaves, while plants that are under heat stress, unhealthy or damaged will lose their turgidity and will wilt.
