<p>Biodiversity refers to all the different kinds of life you can find, including plants, animals, fungi and microorganisms. Healthy gardens will support a variety of plants and animals, and together they make up complex ecosystems that enrich our City in Nature.</p>
<p>Animals bring life and colour into the garden, but they may not always do what we want! <a href="/page-index/biodiversity/pollinators/">Pollinators</a> are popular as they are integral to the fertilisation of many plant species and thus help them produce fruit. <a href="/page-index/pests/pests/">Pests</a> on the other hand, cause damage to plants by feeding on them, but they can be controlled via eco-friendly <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/ipm/">integrated pest management</a> methods, such as by attracting <a href="/page-index/biodiversity/predators/">predators</a> that will eat the pests. In the ground, <a href="/page-index/biodiversity/soil-biodiversity/">soil biodiversity</a> like earthworms and fungi work hard to break down decomposing matter to make nutrients available for plants.   </p>

<p>How we relate to animals is complex, and is dependent on what we expect out of our green spaces, and how we use them. For example, <a href="/page-index/pests/caterpillars/">caterpillars</a> are generally considered a garden pest as they are voracious eaters, and can quickly consume leafy plants. However, they will eventually become <a href="/page-index/biodiversity/pollinators/">butterflies</a>, which are a beautiful sight in any garden and are also pollinators. This tends to make caterpillars valuable in biodiversity-attracting gardens but a pest in edible gardens! </p>
<p>Outdoor gardens will always attract animals, and supporting local biodiversity by growing <a href="/page-index/glossary/native-plants/">native plants</a> and <a href="/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants/">biodiversity-attracting plants</a> is an excellent way to bring nature closer to home. </p>
