	<p>Looking to plan your gardening schedule? Use our planners to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Find the estimated day you should sow seeds in relation to your planned harvest date</li>
		<li>Find your estimated harvest date in relation to when you started your seeds</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Please note that all planner calculations are suggestions, and that the environmental conditions of your garden, like the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">amount of light</a> you receive, how much <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/plant-spacing/">space</a> you have, and your <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilising</a> schedule, may affect the rate at which your plant reaches its harvesting stage. Different crops will have different signs for when they are harvestable, so it is best to <a href="/page-index/glossary/edible-plants/">read up on your plants</a> to determine when you should harvest.</p>
