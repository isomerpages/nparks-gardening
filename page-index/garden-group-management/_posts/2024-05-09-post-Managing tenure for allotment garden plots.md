<p>Allotment-style gardens have individual gardening plots that are rented out to the community. There are allotment gardens directly managed by <a href="/get-involved/allotment-gardens/">NParks in parklands</a> or managed by Town Councils and Grassroots Organisations in housing estates.</p>
<p>Tenure refers to the conditions under which individuals can rent out an allotment plot. They generally cover:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The length of time a plot can be rented</li>
	<li>The cost of renting the plot</li>
	<li>Rules and regulations for the rental and continued usage of a plot</li>
	<li>Timelines and rules for how the plot should be returned at the end of tenure</li>
	</ul>
<h4>Tenure guidelines</h4>
<p>Communities starting their own allotment garden can reference our sample tenure agreement for terms and conditions, and modify them to suit their context. For example, some plots could be set aside for priority groups such wheelchair users for <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/planter-beds/">wheelchair-accessible planter beds</a>, or residents that live nearby.</p>
<p>Download our <a href="https://go.gov.sg/allotment-guide">Guide to Designing and Implementing Allotment Gardens</a> and reference annex A for a sample tenure agreement.</p>
<h4>Tenure timelines</h4>
<p>As plants take time to grow, most allotment plot tenures will be between 2 - 3 years. During this period, gardeners can grow  plants and build structures that are within the rules of the garden.</p>
<p>However, gardeners will need to return the plot in its original state to prepare it for the next gardener. Managing agents should initiate transition planning <b>at least 6 months</b> before the end of the tenure period. This could involve recruiting for new gardeners to join or for existing gardeners to renew their tenure, as per the community's rules. Timely reminders for existing gardeners to prepare for renewal or to transition out is crucial for communities to make the necessary preparations, and to ensure clear communications within the group. </p>
<h4>Tenure termination</h4>
<p>In the event a gardener is no longer able to or unwilling to maintain their allotment plot, the managing agent retains the right to terminate the tenure before the stipulated time. Managing agents are encouraged to have regular check-in with gardeners to gauge their interest in gardening and to remind them of <a href="">good allotment gardening practices</a> to set a standard for maintenance. </p>
