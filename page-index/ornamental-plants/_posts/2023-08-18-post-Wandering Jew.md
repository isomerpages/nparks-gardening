  <h4>Environmental needs:</h4> 
  <p>This plant thrives in 4-6 hours of indirect sunlight, and can tolerate up to 4 hours of direct sun. Too much light will dull the variegation on its leaves while too little light will cause the purple hues to fade.  Plants do best in loamy soil at least 10cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter and grit to let the roots breathe.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Too much light will dull the variegation on its leaves while too little light will cause the purple hues to fade. Wandering Jews tend to get fertiliser burn, and should be fertilised only once every 3-4 months with a dilute balanced fertiliser or a slow-release fertiliser.  Wandering Jews can become leggy and will need regular pruning to keep it bushy. As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming root bound.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
