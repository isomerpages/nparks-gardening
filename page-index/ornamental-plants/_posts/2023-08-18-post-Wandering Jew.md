  <h4>Environmental needs:</h4> 
	<img title="Wandering jew leaves. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/wanderingjew%20(1)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
  <p>This plant thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-6 hours of indirect sunlight</a>, and can tolerate up to 4 hours of direct sun.  Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 10cm deep, making them suitable for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">container gardening</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<img title="Wandering jew leaves that have lost their variegation. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/wanderingjew%20(2)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>Too much light will dull the variegation on its leaves while too little light will cause the purple hues to fade. Wandering Jews tend to get fertiliser burn, and should be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilised only once every 3-4 months with a dilute balanced fertiliser or a slow-release fertiliser</a>.  Wandering Jews can become leggy and will need regular pruning to keep it bushy.</p>
<p>As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-bound/">root bound</a>.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
