	<p>Satin Pothos is a creeping shrub that can grow up to 12m long, and is native to Singapore. You can see them on trees in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Central Catchment Nature Reserve. Its mature leathery leaves are green with white speckles and can be lance or heart shaped. Its flowers are insect pollinated and its fruits are dispersed by birds.</p>
	<p>A perennial plant, Satin Pothos are great for indoor gardens in semi shaded areas. Its attractive, white-spotted green leaves provide texture and colours to landscape designs.</p>

  <h4>Environmental needs:</h4>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
		<p>This plant grows quickly and generally does not need fertilising, but an occasional feed of balanced fertiliser will boost its growth and make it fuller. Water when the top surface of the soil is dry. Keep the plant in bright indirect light for green leaves with variegation. The leaves will lose their variegation and get burned if light is too strong. Ensure that its environment is of high humidity. As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming root bound.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
		<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
		<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites can infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like overwatering, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
