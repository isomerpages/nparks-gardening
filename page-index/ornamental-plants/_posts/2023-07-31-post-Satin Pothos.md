  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
		<p>A dilute fertiliser that has a higher Phosphorous and Potassium content would help encourage flowering. Water when the surface of the soil is dry. Avoid wetting any part of the plant when watering as they are susceptible to rotting. Take care to water directly onto the soil or do bottom-up watering. Make sure that your Flame Violets get enough bright, indirect light to encourage flowering. Avoid direct sun as it may burn its leaves. Ensure that the Flame Violet are placed in an area that has high humidity.</p>

	<br>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
		<p>Flame Violets are susceptible to aphids and mealy bugs. Infested parts can be pruned off or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. If severe infestation occurs, total removal of the infect plant should be considered. Fungal leaf spots, stem blights and root rots can occasionally occur, hence it is important to water only when surface of the soil is dry.</p>
