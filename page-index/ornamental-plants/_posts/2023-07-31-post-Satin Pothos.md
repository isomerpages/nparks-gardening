	<p>Satin Pothos is a creeping shrub that can grow up to 12m long, and is <a href="/page-index/glossary/native-plants/">native</a> to Singapore. You can see them climbling on trees in nature parks like Bukit Timah Hill and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. Its mature leathery leaves are green with white speckles and can be lance or heart shaped. Its flowers are <a href="/page-index/biodiversity/pollinators/">pollinated by insects</a> and its fruits are dispersed by birds.</p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> plant, Satin Pothos are great for indoor gardens in semi shaded areas. Its attractive, white-spotted green leaves provide texture and colours to landscape designs.</p>

  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4> 
  <p>This plant thrives in areas with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">at least 4 hours of indirect sunlight</a> and requires moderate watering. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 10cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>This plant grows quickly and generally does not need fertilising, but feedinga  <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">balanced fertiliser</a> once a year will boost its growth and make it fuller.</p>
	<p>Grow the plant in bright indirect light to keep the variegation on the leaves. The leaves will lose their variegation and get <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">burned</a> if the light is too strong.</p>
	<p>As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-bound/">root bound</a>.</p> 
		<p>Wipe down the leaves with a soft rag to remove dust deposited to prevent pests such as <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">Spider Mites</a>. </p>
	<p>This plant can be trained to climb up a <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/trellises/">trellis</a> or a wall. Take note that the roots used for climbing may leave marks on surfaces.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">Spider Mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
