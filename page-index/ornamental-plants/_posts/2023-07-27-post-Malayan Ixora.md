	<p>Malayan Ixoras are a hardy shrub that is commonly seen in rewilding areas, nature parks, in roadside gardens, and biodiversity-attracting gardens. The nectar-filled flowers is highly attractive to a wide range of insects, including butterflies, ants and moths. The berry-like fruits are attractive birds and small mammals. This plant is also <a href="/page-index/glossary/native-plants/">native</a> to Singapore and is naturally found growing along primary and secondary forests.</p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> shrub, Malayan Ixoras are useful as <a href="/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants/">biodiversity-attracting plants</a> and perimeter plants to add a pop of colour to any garden.</p>

   <p>This plant thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">less than 6 hours of direct sunlight or 4-8 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">moist, well-drained soil</a>.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Malayan Ixoras are steady growers and generally does not need fertilising. This shrub can grow up to 7m in height and will need to be pruned regularly. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regular pruning</a> to promote airflow will keep the plant healthy and neat.</p> 
	<br>

<section> 
  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
	<p>Malayan Ixoras can be grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seed</a> or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">woody cuttings</a> with rooting hormone.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>Malayan Ixoras may look leggy when young. Encourage bushiness with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">regular pruning</a>.</p>
	<p>If the plant does not receive enough light, it will stop producing flowers. Prune surrounding plants or move the plant to a sunnier spot to promote flower growth.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> may occur during periods of hot weather or from the lack of watering. Regular wilting will stunt plant growth. Increase the number of times a plant is watered, or use <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">mulch</a> to retain moisture in the soil.</p>
	<p>This plant may show signs of <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiencies/">iron deficiency</a> in which new leaves will turn pale yellow with dark green veins. This is usually caused by <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogged</a> soil, particularly during the wet season. Improve drainage by mixing in more <a href="/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/"> organic matter</a> or adding a subsoil drain nearby.</p>
