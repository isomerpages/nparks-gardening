	<p>Devil’s Ivy is a  hardy climber that can grow up to 12m long in the wild, that has attractive yellow marble patterns on its leaves. The leaves of young plants are waxy, heart-shaped and green with yellow to white variegation.</p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> plant, the Devil’s Ivy is staple in indoor gardens as it can grow in a wide variety of light conditions. Its climbing vines can be trained up moss poles or draped down from hanging pots. Take note that this plant is also capable of climbing up walls and other flat surfaces if the roots catch hold!</p>

  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
	<img title="Devil's Ivy grown in Hanging pots. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/devilsivy%20(2)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
  <p>This plant thrives in areas with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">2-8 hours of indirect sunlight, and can tolerate up to 4 hours of direct sun</a>. More than 4 hours of direct sun might cause <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">burns</a> on the leaves. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 10cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. This plant is highly drought tolerant, but frequent watering will encourage more growth.</p>

<section> 
  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is hardy and easy to grow. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">Fertilise</a> every other month with a weak liquid balanced fertiliser or apply slow-release fertiliser to encourage more leaves. It is important to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune</a> the stems back every now and then to encourage a bushier growth. 
	</p><p>Wipe down the leaves with a soft rag to remove dust deposited to prevent pests such as <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">Spider Mites</a>. </p>
		<p>This plant can be trained to climb up a <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/trellises/">trellis</a> or a wall. Take note that the roots used for climbing may leave marks on surfaces.</p>
	<p>As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-bound/">root bound</a>.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">mealy bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
