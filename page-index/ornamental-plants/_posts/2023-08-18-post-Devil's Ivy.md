	<p>Devil’s Ivy is a  hardy climber that can grow up to 12m long in the wild, that has attractive yellow marble patterns on its leaves. The leaves of young plants are waxy, heart-shaped and green with yellow to white variegation.</p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> plant, the Devil’s Ivy is staple in indoor gardens as it can grow in a wide variety of light conditions. Its climbing vines can be trained up moss poles or draped down from hanging pots. Take note that this plant is also capable of climbing up walls and other flat surfaces if the roots catch hold!</p>

  <h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<img title="Devil's Ivy grown in Hanging pots. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/devilsivy%20(2)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
  <p>This plant thrives in areas with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">2-8 hours of indirect sunlight, and can tolerate up to 4 hours of direct sun</a>. More than 4 hours of direct sun might cause <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">burns</a> on the leaves. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy</a> at least 10cm deep, making them suitable for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">container gardening</a>. This plant is highly drought tolerant, but frequent watering will encourage more growth.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is hardy and easy to grow. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">Fertilise</a> every other month with a weak liquid balanced fertiliser or apply slow-release fertiliser to encourage more leaves. It is important to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune</a> the stems back every now and then to encourage a bushier growth. Wipe down the leaves with a soft rag to remove dust deposited to prevent pests such as <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a>. As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-bound/">root bound</a>.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">mealy bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regularly prune</a> the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like <a href="/page-index/pests/root-rot/">root rot</a>, lack of sunlight, and <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiencies/">nutrient deficiencies</a>.</p>
