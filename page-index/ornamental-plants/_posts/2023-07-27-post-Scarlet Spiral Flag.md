  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4> 
	<img title="Scarlet Spiral Flag plants used to line a shady area. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/scarletspiralflag%20(2)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
    <p>Scarlet Spiral Flags thrive in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">less than 4 hours of direct sunlight, or 4-6 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a> planting. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your soil drains well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>
	<p>This plant will not do well in places with a lot of direct sunlight, like on rooftop gardens.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Scarlet Spiral Flags grow naturally in clusters as the plant grows more rhizomes, an underground horizontal stem that resembles a tuberous root. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regular pruning</a> and thinning plants will increase airflow and reduce the incidence of pests.</p> 
	<br>

<section> 
  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
	<p>Scarlet Spiral Flags are propagated via <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">division</a> of the rhizome, or by propagating plantlets that form at the base of the spent flowering stalks.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>Leaves may <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">burn</a> if they are exposed to long periods of direct sunlight. Replant under shade or install <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">shade netting</a> to prevent this.</p>
