	<p>The Adanson’s Monstera has green leaf margins and leaf stalks. Mature leaves have holes on each side of the midrib, like a slice of swiss cheese. Its attractive leaves provide an interesting texture in the garden.</p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> climber, the Adanson’s Monstera is a great plant for the indoor garden, and is often planted in a hanging pot or as a <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/trellises/">trellis</a> plant.</p>

  <h4>Environmental needs:</h4> 
	<img title="Adanson’s Monstera plants grown in pots. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/adonsonsmonstera_jacquelinechua.jpg">
  <p>This plant thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-6 hours of indirect sunlight, and up to 4 hours of direct sunlight</a>.  Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>

<section> 
  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Adanson’s Monstera is a low maintenance plant that does best in consistently moist soil and environments with high humidity. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regular pruning</a> will encourage a bushier look. For consistent and rapid growth, this plant can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilised once a month with a high nitrogen fertiliser</a>. As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming root bound.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">mealy bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regularly prune</a> the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, lack of sunlight, and <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiencies/">nutrient deficiencies</a>.</p>
