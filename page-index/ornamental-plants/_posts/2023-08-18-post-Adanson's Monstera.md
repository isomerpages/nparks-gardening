	<p>The Adanson’s Monstera is an attractive plant with interesting leaves that sport holes on each side of the midrib, like a slice of swiss cheese. </p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> climber, the Adanson’s Monstera is a great plant for the indoor garden, and is often planted in a hanging pot or as a <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/trellises/">trellis</a> plant.</p>

  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4> 
	<img title="Adanson’s Monstera plants grown in pots. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/adonsonsmonstera_jacquelinechua.jpg">
  <p>This plant thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-6 hours of indirect sunlight, and up to 4 hours of direct sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 10cm deep. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>

<section> 
  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Adanson’s Monstera is a low maintenance plant that does best in consistently moist soil and environments with high humidity. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regular pruning</a> will encourage a bushier look.</p> 
	<p>For consistent and rapid growth, this plant can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilised once a month with a high nitrogen fertiliser</a>.</p> 
		<p>Wipe down the leaves with a soft rag to remove dust deposited to prevent pests such as <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a>. </p>
<p>As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-bound/">root bound</a>.</p> 
		<p>This plant can be trained to climb up a <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/trellises/">trellis</a> or a wall. Take note that the roots used for climbing may leave marks on surfaces.</p>

  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
	<p>Adanson’s Monstera can be propagated by <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">stem cuttings</a> rooted in soil or water.</p> 
	<br> 
</section> 
 
<section> 
  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>,  and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
