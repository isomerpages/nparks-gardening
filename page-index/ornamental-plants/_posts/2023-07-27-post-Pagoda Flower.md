	<p>Pagoda flowers are a hardy shrub that is commonly seen in low-maintenance beds and biodiversity-attracting gardens. The showy, nectar-filled flowers are highly attractive to butterflies and nectivorous birds.</p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> shrub, Pagoda Flowers are useful as <a href="/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants/">biodiversity-attracting plants</a> and perimeter plants to add a pop of colour to any garden.</p><p>

  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
	<img title="A close up of pagoda flowers. photo by Victoria Lim." src="/images/Plants/pagodaflower%20(2)_victorialim.jpg">
   <p>This plant thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-6 hours of direct sunlight and more than 6 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. This plant does not do well with more than 6 hours of direct sunlight and is not suitable for exposed gardens like on rooftops.</p> 
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 30cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. However, if planted in true ground and left with a lot of space, the plant can rapidly grow suckers and spread. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe. This plant is relatively drought tolerant and can withstand some neglect.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Pagoda flowers are rapid growers but do benefit from being <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fed high potassium and phosphorus fertilisers</a> to encourage flowering. This shrub can grow up to 1.5m in height and will need to be pruned regularly. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regular pruning</a> after flowering will keep the plant healthy and neat, and encourage a bushier growth. Remove suckers regularly to manage its spread.</p> 
	<br>

<section> 
  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
	<p>Pagoda flowers can be propagated from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">suckers or </a><a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">woody cuttings</a> with rooting hormone.</p> 
	<br> 
</section> 
 
<section> 
  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
		<p>Pagoda Flowers will grow leggy when left unmanaged. Encourage bushiness with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">regular pruning</a>.</p>
	<p>If your plant has few to no flowers, you can fertilise the plant with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers high in phosphorus and potassium</a>. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>
		<p>If the plant does not receive enough light, it will stop producing flowers. Prune surrounding plants or move the plant to a sunnier spot to promote flower growth.</p>
<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
