	<img title="Maiden's Jealousy vines grown in a plant nursery. Photo by Victoria lim." src="/images/Plants/maidensjealousy%20(1)_victorialim.jpg">
   <p>This plant thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-8 hours of direct sunlight</a>. It can also tolerate areas with more than 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but may produce less flowers. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 30cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe. This plant is a versatile climber that does well on a variety of <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/trellises/">trellises</a>.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Maiden’s Jealousy are rapid growers and generally does not need fertilizing. The vine can rapidly grow up to 10m in height if it has a high enough trellis and will need to be pruned regularly. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regular pruning</a> to promote airflow will keep the plant healthy and neat.</p>

  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
	<p>Maiden’s Jealousy can be grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seed</a> or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">woody cuttings</a> with rooting hormone.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>If your plant has few to no flowers, you can fertilise the plant with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers high in phosphorus and potassium</a>.</p>
	<p>If the plant does not receive enough light, it will stop producing flowers. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Prune</a> surrounding plants or move the plant to a sunnier spot to promote flower growth.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> may occur during periods of hot weather or from the lack of watering. Regular wilting will stunt plant growth. Increase the number of times a plant is watered, or use <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">mulch</a> to retain moisture in the soil.</p>
