	<p>The Flame Violets are a fast growing, herbaceous creeping shrub with runners that produce plantlets. It has velvety and patterned leaves, often with a copper tinge.Its trumpet-shaped flowers are bright red and furry in texture, usually blooming for two to three days.</p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> flower, Flame Violets are great for <a href="/page-index/housekeeping/good-corridor-gardening-practices/">corridor</a>, indoor, or shady gardens. Different cultivars have different leaf and flower colours. Due to its creeping nature, it looks beautiful in hanging baskets. It is also suitable for terrariums.</p>

  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4> 
  <p>This plant thrives in areas with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">at least 4 hours of indirect sunlight</a>, but will <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">burn</a> in more than 6 hours of direct sunlight. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 10cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Applying a <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">dilute fertiliser with a higher phosphorous and potassium content</a> once every two months will help encourage flowering. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Pruning</a> spent flowers encourages the plant to flower again. </p>
<p>Take care to water directly onto the soil or do <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/bottom-watering/">bottom-up watering</a> as water on the leaves causes rot. Make sure that your Flame Violets get enough bright, indirect light to encourage flowering.</p>
		<p>As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-bound/">root bound</a>.</p>

  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
	<p>Flame Violets can be propagated by <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">stem cuttings</a> or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">plantlets</a>.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
	<p>Fungal leafspots, stem blights and <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a> can occur when the plant is <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering/">overwatered</a>. Water only when the surface of the soil is dry.</p>
