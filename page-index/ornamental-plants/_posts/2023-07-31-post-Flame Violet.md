	<p>The Flame Violets are a fast growing, herbaceous creeping shrub with runners that produce plantlets. It has velvety and patterned leaves, often with a copper tinge. It has trumpet-shaped flowers that are bright red and furry in texture, usually blooming for two to three days.</p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> flower, Flame Violets are great for indoor gardens or partial sun gardens. Different cultivars have different leaf and flower colours. Due to its creeping nature, it looks beautiful in hanging baskets. It is also suitable for terrariums.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Regular application of a dilute fertiliser with a higher Phosphorous and Potassium content will help encourage flowering. Water when the surface of the soil is dry. Take care to water directly onto the soil or do bottom-up watering as water on the leaves causes rot. Make sure that your Flame Violets get enough bright, indirect light to encourage flowering. Avoid direct sun as it may burn its leaves. Ensure that the Flame Violet are placed in an area that has high humidity. As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming root bound.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
		<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
		<p>Fungal leafspots, stem blights and root rotting can occur when the plant is overwatered. Water only when the surface of the soil is dry.</p>
