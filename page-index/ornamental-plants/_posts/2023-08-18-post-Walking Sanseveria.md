	<h3>Walking Sansevieria (<em>Dracaena pinguicula</em>)</h3> 
</header>

<section>
	<p>Walking Sansevieria is a slow growing plant with thick attractive leaves can grow up to 30cm wide. When young, its thick, fleshy leaves are arranged in a rosette. As the plant matures, the leaf arrangement changes to two rows opposite each other. The leaves are bluish to grey with reddish margins. This plant is named as such because it will grow offshoots with stilt-like roots that resemble legs walking away from the parent plant.</p>
	<p>A perennial, succulent shrub, Walking Sansevieria is good for planting in containers, either on its own or as part of a succulent dish garden.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Peace Lilies are low maintenance plants that can be fertilised monthly with a balanced liquid fertiliser. Peace lilies will wilt dramatically when underwatered and will also quickly bounce back once they have been watered. As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming root bound.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
