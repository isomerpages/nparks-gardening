	<p>Spider Plants are a clump forming shrub with green linear leaves. The leaves arch backwards to form a fountain-like shape. It has star-shaped flowers and its plantlets grow along a thin inflorescent stalk which hangs downward, reminiscent of spiders dangling from a thread. After flowering, more leaves are produced at the tip of the stem, forming small plantlets.</p>
	<p>A perennial plant, Spider Plants are great indoor plants as they grow well in pots in shady areas. Their fountain-like shape and hanging plantlets make them a popular choice for hanging pots.</p>

  <h4>Environmental needs:</h4> 
  <p>This plant thrives in 4-8 hours of indirect sunlight, but may burn in direct sun.  Plants do best in loamy soil at least 10cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Spider Plants are very hardy and can grow quickly with very little care. This plant can tolerate some neglect, but will grow lush and produce more leaves when the soil is kept moist with regular watering. Root-bound Spider Plants are more likely to produce plantlets. Plants should be fertilised with balanced fertiliser once every 3-4 months as heavily fertilised plants may not produce as many plantlets.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
