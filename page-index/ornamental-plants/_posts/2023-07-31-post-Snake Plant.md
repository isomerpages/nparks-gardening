  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>It is easy to grow and is low maintenance. Due to its ability to withstand drought, it is better to underwater the plant to prevent potential <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>. As it is slow growing, it does not require frequent fertilising. A <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">balanced liquid fertiliser once a month or slow releasing fertiliser</a> is sufficient. As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming root bound.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
