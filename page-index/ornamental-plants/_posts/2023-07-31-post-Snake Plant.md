	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> plant, Snake plants are versatile and can grow indoors, outdoors and even on rooftop gardens due to its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions.

  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4> 
  <p>This plant thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">at least 2 hours of direct sunlight or with a minimum of 4 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy or sandy soil</a> at least 10cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>..</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Due to its ability to withstand drought, it is better to underwater the plant to prevent potential <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>. As it is slow growing, it does not require frequent fertilising. A <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">balanced liquid fertiliser</a> once every two months is sufficient.</p>
<p>As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-bound/">root bound</a>.</p>

  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
	<p>Snake plants can be propagated by <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">leaf cuttings</a> or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">division</a>.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<img title="Snake plants in true ground suffering from multiple plant problems due to overcorwding. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/snakeplant_burning_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>This plant is susceptible to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a> if grown in <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogged soil</a>. To prevent rot, grow the plant in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">sandy soil</a> with plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">inorganic soil amendments</a>. Plants can also be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/bottom-watering/">bottom watered</a> once a week or less to keep the soil airy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like root rot. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
	<p>This plant will need regular <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">division</a> of offshoots to prevent the plant from getting <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-bound/">root bound</a> too rapidly. These plants can also quickly taker over a garden if not contained within a <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/planter-beds/">planter bed</a>.</p>
