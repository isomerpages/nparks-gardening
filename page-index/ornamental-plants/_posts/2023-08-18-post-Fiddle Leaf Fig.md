	<p>The Fiddle Leaf Fig is a small to medium sized tree that can grow up to 12m tall when grown in true ground, but it is usually kept as a small potted shrub around 30cm tall or a small tree at 2m or less. Its large leathery leaves have a wavy leaf margin and are a glossy dark green colour with prominent yellow veins on its upper surface. It has bark that is greyish with shallow fissures.</p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> evergreen tree, the Fiddle Leaf Fig is a popular plant to grow both indoors and outdoors. Its interesting leaf shape and striking leaf venation adds character to a home or garden.</p>

  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
	<img title="A large fiddle leaf fig grown in true ground. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/fiddleleaffig%20(1)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
  <p>This plant can grow to its full size in areas with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">at least 6 hours of direct sunlight</a>. However, most gardeners keep it in areas with 4-6 hours of direct sunlight or at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight to slow its growth and keep it at a more manageable size.</p> 
	<p> Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 15cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. </p><p>
These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<img title="Fiddle leaf figs being sold as small houseplants. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/fiddleleaffig%20(6)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>The Fiddle Leaf Fig start off as a slow growing plant and prefers partial shade when young. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">Fertilising</a> should only be done once a month with a dilute balanced liquid fertiliser. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Pruning</a> the growing tips or top of the plant when it is young will encourage branching. </p>
	<p><b>When pruning, be sure to wear gloves as the plant produces a milky, sticky sap which is mildly toxic and can irritate the skin.</b></p>
	<p> As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-bound/">root bound</a>.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
<p> <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/scale-insects/">Scale insects</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">Spider Mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
