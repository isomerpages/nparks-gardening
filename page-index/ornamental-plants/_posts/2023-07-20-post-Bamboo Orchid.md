	<p>Bamboo Orchids are a hardy free-flowering plant that is commonly seen in rewilding areas, nature parks, in roadside gardens, and biodiversity-attracting gardens. The flowers can be stir-fried, and have a taste similar to <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/bitter-gourd/">Bitter Gourd</a>. This plant is also <a href="/page-index/glossary/native-plants/">native</a> to Singapore and is naturally found growing along forest streams and grassy areas.</p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> flower, Bamboo Orchids are useful as <a href="/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants/">bee-attracting plants</a> to add a pop of colour to any garden.</p>

  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4> 
  <p> This plant thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-8 hours of direct sunlight</a>, but can also grow in at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight but may flower less. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 15cm deep or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<img title="A clump of Bamboo Orchids. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/bambooorchid%20(2)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>Bamboo Orchids are rapid growers and generally does not need fertilizing. They naturally grow in clumps and produce <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">suckers that can be propagated by division</a>. Regular <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> and division to promote airflow will keep the plant healthy and neat.</p>

<section> 
  <h4>Harvesting:</h4> 
	<p>The plant can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for the flower at any time.</p>
	<p>Bamboo Orchids produce wind-dispersed seeds from cigar-shaped seed pods. Seeds can be harvested for planting when the pods are dry and begin to crack, or after they begin to split open.</p>

<section> 
  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
	<p>Bamboo Orchids can be grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seeds</a> or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">division of suckers</a>.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>If your plant has few to no flowers, you can fertilise the plant with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers high in phosphorus and potassium</a>.</p>
	<p>If the plant does not receive enough light, it will stop producing flowers. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Prune</a> surrounding plants or move the orchid to a sunnier spot to promote flower growth.</p>
			<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">Spider Mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> may occur during periods of hot weather or from the lack of watering. Regular wilting will stunt plant growth. Increase the number of times a plant is watered, or use <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">mulch</a> to retain moisture in the soil.</p>
