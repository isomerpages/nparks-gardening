  <p>This plant thrives in 4-8 hours of direct sunlight. This plant can also grow in at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but at a slower pace.  Plants do best in loamy soil at least 10cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe.</p>
