	<p>The Peace Lilies are herbaceous plants that can grow up to 50cm tall and wide. It has glossy, dark green leaves and elegant white flowers. This is a common flowering indoor plant that is easy to care for.</p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> evergreen plant, it is a great choice for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">container planting</a> as it grows in clumps, rapidly filling out pots.</p>

  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4> 
	<img title="PeaceLilies growing in true ground. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/peacelily%20(5)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
  <p>This plant thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">2-6 hours of indirect sunlight</a>, and <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">will burn in direct sun</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 15cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe. This plant is prone to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">wilting</a>, and will need consistently moist soil to grow well.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Peace Lilies are low maintenance plants that can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilised monthly with a balanced liquid fertiliser</a>. Peace lilies will wilt dramatically when <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering/">underwatered</a> and will also quickly bounce back once they have been watered. As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-bound/">root bound</a>.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
		<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> may occur during periods of hot weather or from the lack of watering. Regular wilting will stunt plant growth. Increase the number of times a plant is watered, or use <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">mulch</a> to retain moisture in the soil.</p>
