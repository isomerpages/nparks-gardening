	<p>Aloe Vera is a succulent herb that grows usually up to 0.3 – 0.6m but can be 1.2m tall in the wild. It has long fleshy triangular leaves arranged in a rosette and is drought tolerant. The smooth leaves are light green with white spots and a spiny leaf margin. It has golden yellow flowers that grows in a cluster, forming an inflorescence.</p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a>, fleshy herb, Aloe Veras are great plants to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">grown in containers</a> outdoors. Or in gardens with sandy soil. Historically, Aloe Vera gel has been used for a wide range of skin conditions and was thought to promote wound healing and soothe inflammations. The jelly-like flesh of the leaves is also edible, and often used in beverages and desserts.</p>

  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4> 
  <p>This plant thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">at least 6 hours of direct sunlight</a>. It can also grow in 4-6hours of direct sunlight or at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but at a much slower rate.  They do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">porous, well-drained soil</a> and require moderate watering.</p>

<section> 
  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Watering should be done at the soil level if possible, to prevent water collecting on the leaves which can cause fungal diseases, leading to rot. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">Fertilise</a> Aloe Veras sparingly, at most once a month with a balanced fertiliser at half the dosage. You may also want to divide new offshoots as they form, so that the mother plant will not grow off centre.</p>

<section> 
  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
	<p>Aloe Vera can be grown from the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">division of offshoots</a>.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is susceptible to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a> if grown in <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogged soil</a>. To prevent rot, grow the plant in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">sandy soil</a> with plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">inorganic soil amendments</a>. Plants can also be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/bottom-watering/">bottom watered</a> once a week or less to keep the soil airy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like root rot. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
