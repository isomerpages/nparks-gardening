	<p>Aloe Vera is a succulent herb that grows usually up to 0.3 – 0.6m but can be 1.2m tall in the wild. It has long fleshy triangular leaves arranged in a rosette and is drought tolerant. The smooth leaves are light green with white spots and a spiny leaf margin. It has golden yellow flowers that grows in a cluster, forming an inflorescence.</p>
	<p>A perennial, fleshy herb, Aloe Veras are great plants to grown in containers outdoors. Or in gardens with sandy soil. Historically, Aloe Vera gel has been used for a wide range of skin conditions and was thought to promote wound healing and soothe inflammations. The jelly-like flesh of the leaves is also edible, and often used in beverages and desserts.</p>

  <h4>Environmental needs:</h4> 
    	<p>This plant thrives in at least 6 hours of direct sunlight. It can also grow in 4-6hours of direct sunlight or at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but at a much slower rate.  They do best in porous, well-drained soil and require moderate watering.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
		<p>Watering should be done at the soil level if possible, to prevent water collecting on the leaves which can cause fungal diseases, leading to rot. Fertilise Aloe Veras sparingly, at most once a month with a balanced fertiliser at half the dosage. You may also want to divide new offshoots as they form, so that the mother plant will not grow off centre.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
		<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
		<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
