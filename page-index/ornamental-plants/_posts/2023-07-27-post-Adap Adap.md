The flowers are attractive to bees and butterflies, while the fruits attract birds and small mammals. This plant is also <a href="/page-index/glossary/native-plants/">native</a> to Singapore and is naturally found growing along freshwater swamp forest and secondary forests.</p>

  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4> 
  <p> This plant thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-8 hours of direct sunlight or at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 30cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Adap-Adap are steady growers and generally does not need fertilising. The shrub can grow up to 1m in height and will need to be pruned regularly. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regular pruning</a> to promote airflow will keep the plant healthy and neat.</p>

<section> 
  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
	<p>Adap-Adap can be grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seed</a> or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">woody cuttings</a> with rooting hormone.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>If your plant has few to no flowers, you can fertilise the plant with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers high in phosphorus and potassium</a>.</p>
	<p>If the plant does not receive enough light, it will stop producing flowers. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Prune</a> surrounding plants or move the plant to a sunnier spot to promote flower growth.</p>
