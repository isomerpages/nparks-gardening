	<p>Globe Amaranths produce small, striking white, purple or pink flowers that can be boiled into tea, or preserved to be used in cut flower arrangements. The flowers also attract a variety of bees and butterflies.</p>
	<p>A small annual shrub, Globe Amaranths are typically grown as part of perimeter planting, or in ornamental gardens, edible gardens, and biodiversity-attracting gardens.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
		<p>Globe Amaranth grows best in 6-8 hours of direct sunlight. Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil, but are also tolerant of sandy and heavy clay soils. Soil needs to be at least 10cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening.</p>
	<br>

<section>
  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
		<p>Sow seeds individually in a seedling tray filled with potting mix or seedling mix. Lightly mist the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 10 days.</p>

	<br>
		<p>The seedlings will be vulnerable to high heat and heavy rain and are best kept in a sheltered propagation area or a shaded space with around 4 hours of partial or direct sunlight.</p> 
		<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 10cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 10 days.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Transplanting:</h4>
		<p>Seedlings will be ready for transplanting into pots or true ground when they have developed 4 or more leaves, or roughly a week or two after germination. Leave 10cm between each plant to encourage more growth and better ventilation.</p>
	<br>
</section>
	
<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
		<p>Globe Amaranth will produce more flowers when fed with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. Plants can be fertilised regularly a month after germination for more flowers.</p>
		<p>It is a good practice to prune regularly and remove dead leaves and stems to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant. Regular pruning also decreases the likelihood of pests quickly taking over the plant.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
		<p>Plants can be harvested for flowers at any time.  Fruits can be harvested for seeds when they are brown and dry.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
		<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
		<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
		<p>This plant is prone to rust and fungal diseases during the wet season. Prune the plant regularly to increase airflow, and remove heavily affected leaves.</p>
		<p>Wilting may occur during periods of hot weather or from the lack of watering. Regular wilting will stunt plant growth. Increase the number of times a plant is watered, or use mulch to retain moisture in the soil.</p>
