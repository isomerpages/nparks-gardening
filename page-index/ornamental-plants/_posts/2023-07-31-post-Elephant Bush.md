  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
		<p>Elephant Bush plants are usually quite resistant to pests if kept healthy.</p>
		<p>Mealy bugs often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
