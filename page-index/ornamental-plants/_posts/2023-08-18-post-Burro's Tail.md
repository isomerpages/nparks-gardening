	<img title="Burro's tail plant. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/burrostail_jacquelinechua.jpg">
  <p>This plant thrives in areas with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-6 hours of indirect sun</a> but may <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">burn</a> if exposed to more than 6 hours of direct sunlight. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">sandy soil</a> at least 10cm deep.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Burro’s Tail plants grow best in areas with plenty of indirect light and airflow, making them ideal hanging plants for balconies. However, this plant needs to be handled with care as their leaves tend to drop easily. Dropped leaves can be repropagated into new plants, and bare stems can also be pruned to be repropagated as stem cuttings.</p>
	<p>It is important to water the plant only when the soil is dry as it is very vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>. These plants generally do not need to be fertilised, but <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">a balanced slow-release fertiliser</a> applied once every other month will keep the plant lush and growing steadily.</p>
