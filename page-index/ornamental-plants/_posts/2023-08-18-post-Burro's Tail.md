  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
		<p>Burro’s Tail plants grow best in areas with plenty of indirect light and airflow, making them ideal hanging plants for balconies. However, this plant needs to be handled with care as their leaves tend to drop easily. Dropped leaves can be repropagated into new plants, and bare stems can also be pruned to be repropagated as stem cuttings.</p>
	<p>It is important to water the plant only when the soil is dry as it is very vulnerable to root rot. These plants generally do not need to be fertilised, but a balanced slow-release fertiliser applied once every other month will keep the plant lush and growing steadily.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
		<p>Elephant Bush plants are usually quite resistant to pests if kept healthy.</p>
		<p>Aphids, scale insects and Spider mites often infect plants that have underlying problems like a lack of light, root rot, or nutrient deficiencies. It is usually difficult to completely remove these pests, making it critical to immediately prune off infected parts and horticultural oils like neem oil to suffocate remaining pests. All infected plants should be quarantined to prevent further spread, and severely infected plants should be completely disposed of.</p>
