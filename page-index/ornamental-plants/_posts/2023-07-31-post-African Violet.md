  <h4>Environmental needs:</h4> 
  <p>This plant thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">at least 4 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">porous, well-drained soil</a> and require moderate watering.</p> 
	<br>

<section> 
  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Applying a <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">dilute fertiliser with a higher Phosphorous and Potassium content</a> once every two months will help encourage flowering. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Pruning</a> spent flowers encourages the plant to flower again. </p>
		<p>Take care to water directly onto the soil or do <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/bottom-watering/">bottom-up watering</a> as water on the leaves causes rot.</p>
		<p>As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-bound/">root bound</a>.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
		<p>African Violets leaves are susceptible to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, Powdery Mildew and fungal spots if kept in high humidity or if the leaves are in contact with water for too long. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/bottom-watering/">Bottom watering</a> would be the best way to avoid getting excess water on its foliage.</p>
<p><a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a> and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
