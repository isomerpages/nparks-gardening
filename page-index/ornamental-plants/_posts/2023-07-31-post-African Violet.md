	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> flower, African Violets are a classic plant for indoor gardens and <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">container gardening</a>.</p>

  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4> 
  <p>This plant thrives in areas with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">at least 4 hours of indirect sunlight</a>, but will <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">burn</a> in more than 6 hours of direct sunlight. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">sandy or loamy soil</a> at least 10cm deep, making them suitable for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-container/">container gardening</a>.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Applying a <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">dilute fertiliser with a higher Phosphorous and Potassium content</a> once every two months will help encourage flowering. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Pruning</a> spent flowers encourages the plant to flower again. </p>
		<p>Take care to water directly onto the soil or do <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/bottom-watering/">bottom-up watering</a> as water on the leaves causes rot.</p>
		<p>As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-bound/">root bound</a>.</p>

  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
		<p>African Violets can be grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seed</a>, <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">division of clumps</a> or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">leaf cuttings</a>.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
		<p>African Violets leaves tend to rot if kept in high humidity or if the leaves are in contact with water for too long. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/bottom-watering/">Bottom watering</a> would be the best way to avoid getting excess water on its foliage.</p>
	<p>This plant is susceptible to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a> if grown in <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogged soil</a>. To prevent rot, grow the plant in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">sandy soil</a> with plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">inorganic soil amendments</a>. Plants can also be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/bottom-watering/">bottom watered</a> once a week or less to keep the soil airy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like root rot. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
