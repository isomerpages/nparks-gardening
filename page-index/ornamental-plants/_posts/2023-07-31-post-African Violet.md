	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> flower, African Violets are great for indoor gardens or as a groundcover in partial shade areas. It has violet-blue or white flowers which contrast nicely against their dark green leaves. Other cultivars of the African Violet have flowers that come in shades of purple, red and white.

  <h4>Environmental needs:</h4> 
  <p>This plant thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">at least 4 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">porous, well-drained soil</a> and require moderate watering.</p>

<section> 
  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Regular application of a <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">dilute fertiliser with a higher Phosphorous and Potassium content</a> will help encourage flowering. Water when the surface of the soil is dry. Take care to water directly onto the soil or do <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/bottom-watering/">bottom-up watering</a> as water on the leaves causes rot. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Pruning</a> spent flowers encourages the plant to flower again. As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming root bound.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
		<p>African Violets leaves are susceptible to rot, Powdery Mildew and fungal spots if kept in high humidity or if the leaves are in contact with water for too long. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/bottom-watering/">Bottom watering</a> would be the best way to avoid getting excess water on its foliage.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">Spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regularly prune</a> the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, lack of sunlight, and <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiencies/">nutrient deficiencies.</a></p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiencies/">
