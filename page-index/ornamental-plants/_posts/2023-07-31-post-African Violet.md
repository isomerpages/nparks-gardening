  <h4>Environmental needs:</h4> 
    	<p>Scarlet Spiral Flags thrive in less than 4 hours of direct sunlight, or 4-6 hours of indirect sunlight. Plants do best in true ground planting. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your soil drains well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe.</p>
		<p>This plant will not do well in places with a lot of direct sunlight, like on rooftop gardens.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
		<p>Scarlet Spiral Flags grow naturally in clusters as the plant grows more rhizomes, an underground horizontal stem that resembles a tuberous root. Regular pruning and thinning plants will increase airflow and reduce the incidence of pests.</p> 
	<br>

<section> 
  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
		<p>Scarlet Spiral Flags are propagated via division of the rhizome, or by propagating plantlets that form at the base of the spent flowering stalks.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
		<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
		<p>Leaves may burn if they are exposed to long periods of direct sunlight. Replant under shade or install shade netting to prevent this.</p>
