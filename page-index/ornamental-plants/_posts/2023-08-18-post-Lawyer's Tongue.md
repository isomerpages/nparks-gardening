	<p>Lawyer’s Tongue is a unique-looking succulent with leaves they look like they are layered upon one another like a fan. It is usually kept as a small plant less than 20cm tall, but can get up to 50cm tall if it is kept in a large enough pot.</p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a>, succulent shrub, Lawyer’s Tongue make good additions to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">container gardening</a> or in a succulent dish arrangement.</p>

  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4> 
  <p>Lawyer’s Tongue grows best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-8 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. Some direct sunlight will cause its leaf tips to flush red, but more than 6 hours of direct sun will cause <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">sunburn</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">sandy soil</a> at least 10cm deep.</p>

	<p>Lawyer’s Tongue does not need frequent fertilising. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">A balanced slow releasing fertiliser</a> every few months would be sufficient for steady growth. Ensure that there is good airflow to dry out the soil before watering again.</p> 
		<p>This plant requires very little water and is vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>. Consider <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/bottom-watering/">bottom watering</a> this plant once  every week or less to reduce the chances of rot.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is largely resistant to most pests.</p>
	<p>This plant is susceptible to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a> if grown in <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogged soil</a>. To prevent rot, grow the plant in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">sandy soil</a> with plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">inorganic soil amendments</a>. Plants can also be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/bottom-watering/">bottom watered</a> once a week or less to keep the soil airy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like root rot. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
