	<p>Mistletoe Figs are a small, hardy free-fruiting shrub that is commonly seen in rewilding areas, nature parks, in roadside gardens, and biodiversity-attracting gardens. The fruits are attractive to birds and small mammals. This plant is also native to Singapore and is naturally found growing along scrub and areas with sandy soil.</p>
	<p>A perennial shrub, Mistletoe Figs are useful as biodiversity-attracting plants and perimeter plants to add a pop of colour to any garden. They are also highly drought resistant and will do well in exposed gardens such as those on rooftops.</p>
