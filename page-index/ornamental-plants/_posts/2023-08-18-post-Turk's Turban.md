	<p>Turk’s Turbans are large, hardy, <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#f">free-flowering</a> shrubs that are commonly seen in roadside gardens, perimeter planting and biodiversity-attracting gardens. The nectar-filled flowers are highly attractive to nectivorous birds.</p>
	<p>As large and woody <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> bush, this plant is a staple in perimeter planting, biodiversity-attracting gardens, and low-maintenance beds.</p>
	<p>This plant is part of the Malvaceae or Hibiscus family, which includes other plants like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/ladys-finger/">Lady’s-Finger</a> and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/cranberry-hibiscus/">Cranberry Hibiscus</a>.</p>

  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4> 
	<p>This plant does best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight</a>.</p>
<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 30cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Turk’s Turbans are rapid growers but do benefit from being fed <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">high potassium and phosphorus fertilisers</a> to encourage flowering. This shrub can grow up to 1m in height and will need to be pruned regularly. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regular pruning</a> will keep the plant healthy and neat and encourage a bushier growth.</p>

<section> 
  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
	<p>Turk’s Turbans are usually propagated via <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">woody cuttings</a> with rooting hormone.</p> 
	<br> 
</section> 
 
<section> 
  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>If your plant has little to no flowers, you try <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilising</a> the plant with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth.</p>
<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/scale-insects/">Scale Insects</a>, often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
