	<p>Turk’s Turbans are large, hardy, free-flowering shrubs that are commonly seen in roadside gardens, perimeter planting and biodiversity-attracting gardens. The nectar-filled flowers are highly attractive to nectivorous birds.</p>
	<p>As large and woody perennial bush, this plant is a staple in perimeter planting, biodiversity-attracting gardens, and low-maintenance beds.</p>
	<p>This plant is part of the Malvaceae or Hibiscus family, which includes other plants like Lady’s-Finger and Cranberry Hibiscus.</p>

  <h4>Environmental needs:</h4> 
	<p>This plant does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 15cm deep, or in true ground. Plants do best in loamy soil at least 20cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening, but will rapidly grow to their full size in true ground. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Turk’s Turbans are rapid growers but do benefit from being fed high potassium and phosphorus fertilisers to encourage flowering. This shrub can grow up to 1m in height and will need to be pruned regularly. Regular pruning will keep the plant healthy and neat and encourage a bushier growth.</p>

  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
	<p>Turk’s Turbans can be grown from seed, but they are usually propagated via woody cuttings with rooting hormone.</p> 
	<br>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>If your plant has little to no flowers, you try fertilising the plant with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth.</p>
	<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
