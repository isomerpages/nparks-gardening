  <p>This plant thrives in 4-8 hours of direct sunlight. This plant can also grow in at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but growth will be slower and the plant will produce less flowers. Plants do best in loamy soil. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe. This plant is a versatile climber that does well on a variety of trellises.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Coral Vines are rapid growers and generally does not need fertilizing. The vine can rapidly grow up to 12m in height if it has a high enough trellis and will need to be pruned regularly. Regular pruning to promote airflow will keep the plant healthy and neat. The plant tends to flower towards the top, so regular pruning will encourage it to flower more uniformly.</p>
