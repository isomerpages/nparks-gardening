	<p>Walking Sansevieria is a slow growing plant with thick attractive leaves can grow up to 30cm wide. When young, its thick, fleshy leaves are arranged in a rosette. As the plant matures, the leaf arrangement changes to two rows opposite each other. The leaves are bluish to grey with reddish margins. This plant is named as such because it will grow offshoots with stilt-like roots that resemble legs walking away from the parent plant.</p>
	<p>A perennial, succulent shrub, Walking Sansevieria is good for planting in containers, either on its own or as part of a succulent dish garden.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is largely resistant to most pests.</p>
	<p>This plant is susceptible to root rot if grown in waterlogged soil. To prevent rot, allow the plant to dry out between waterings and ensure that there is enough air circulation.</p>
	<p>Mealy bugs may infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
