	<p>Mexican Sedum is a creeping succulent groundcover that can grow up to 10cm tall. It has bright green fleshy leaves on upright stems that creep to form dense mats. The leaves are linear and needle-like, arranged in whorls of 4-5 around stems.</p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> succulent plant, it is a useful groundcover plant, a foreground plant in a shallow succulent dish arrangement, or a feature plant for hanging containers. Its drought tolerance and love for full sun has made it a suitable candidate for green roofs and has been used widely in Singapore.</p>

  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4> 
  <p>Mexican Sedum thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">more than 4 hours of direct sunlight</a>. It can also grow in more than 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but growth will be slow and the colour less vibrant. It grows best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">sandy soil</a> at least 5cm deep with plenty of drainage, making it <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">suitable for containers</a>, rooftops, and other exposed areas. It will not tolerate <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogging</a>, and can die quickly if left standing in water.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Mexican Sedum can be grown in shallow pots with sandy soil. Allow the soil to dry out completely before watering deeply. As this plant is rather fast growing, it will benefit from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">a balanced organic fertiliser</a>  once every 3 or 4 months. Too much fertiliser can result in a leggy plant. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regular pruning</a> will encourage bushier growth.</p>

  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
	<p>Mexican Sedum can be grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">stem and leaf cuttings</a>.</p>

<section> 
  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>Mexican Sedum are largely resistant to most pests.</p>
	<p>This plant is susceptible to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a> if grown in <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogged soil</a>. To prevent rot, grow the plant in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">sandy soil</a> with plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">inorganic soil amendments</a>. Plants can also be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/bottom-watering/">bottom watered</a> once a week or less to keep the soil airy.</p>
