  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4> 
  <p>Fairy Washboards thrive in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-6 hours of indirect sunlight</a>, but are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">sunburn</a> in areas with more than 4 hours of direct sunlight.

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Fairy Washboards are slow-growing and generally low maintenance. They do well with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">slow-release balanced fertilisers</a> once a year during repotting, and will flower occasionally. Prune off spent flowers to keep the plant neat.</p> 
	<p>This plant requires very little water and is vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>. Consider <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/bottom-watering/">bottom watering</a> this plant once  every two weeks or less to reduce the chances of rot.</p>
	<p>As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-bound/">root bound</a>.</p>
