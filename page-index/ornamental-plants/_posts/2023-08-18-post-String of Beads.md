	<p>String of beads is a trailing succulent with thick spherical fleshy leaves that are arranged along its stems. Each shiny light green leaf has a transparent ‘window’ that allows light to penetrate the leaf interior to allow for photosynthesis while minimising water loss.</p>
	<p>A perennial succulent vine, its long pendulous stems make it an attractive plant for growing in hanging or tall planters.</p>

  <h4>Environmental needs:</h4> 
  <p>String of beads thrive in 4-6 hours of indirect sunlight or around 4 hours of direct sun. They are best planted in sandy soil around 10-15cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening. This plant is vulnerable to root rot, and will need soil with plenty of grit for good drainage. The leaves of String of Beads can split open if it is suddenly exposed to a lot of water, and is thus best kept out of direct rain, especially during the monsoon season.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
