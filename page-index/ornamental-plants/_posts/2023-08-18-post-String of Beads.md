	<p>String of beads is a trailing succulent with thick spherical fleshy leaves that are arranged along its stems. Each shiny light green leaf has a transparent ‘window’ that allows light to penetrate the leaf interior to allow for photosynthesis while minimising water loss.</p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> succulent vine, its long pendulous stems make it an attractive plant for growing in hanging or tall planters.</p>

  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4> 
  <p>String of beads thrive in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-6 hours of indirect sunlight or around 4 hours of direct sun</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">sandy soil</a> at least 10cm deep. This plant is vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, and will need soil with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">plenty of inorganic soil amendments</a> for good drainage. </p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>String of beads does not need frequent fertilising. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">A balanced slow releasing fertiliser</a> applied every 6 months would be sufficient. Allow the soil to dry out completely before watering. This plant does well with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/bottom-watering/">bottom watering</a>.</p> 
	<p>The leaves of String of Beads can split open if it is suddenly exposed to a lot of water, and is thus best kept out of direct rain, especially during the monsoon season.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is largely resistant to most pests.</p>
	<p>This plant is susceptible to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a> if grown in <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogged</a> soil. To prevent rot, allow the plant to dry out between waterings and ensure that there is enough air circulation.</p>
<p><a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like waterlogging. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
