	<p>String of beads is a trailing succulent with thick spherical fleshy leaves that are arranged along its stems. Each shiny light green leaf has a transparent ‘window’ that allows light to penetrate the leaf interior to allow for photosynthesis while minimising water loss.</p>
	<p>A perennial succulent vine, its long pendulous stems make it an attractive plant for growing in hanging or tall planters.</p>

  <h4>Environmental needs:</h4> 
  <p>This plant thrives in 2-6 hours of indirect sunlight, and will burn in direct sun. Plants do best in loamy soil. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe. This plant is prone to wilting, and will need consistently moist soil to grow well.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Peace Lilies are low maintenance plants that can be fertilised monthly with a balanced liquid fertiliser. Peace lilies will wilt dramatically when underwatered and will also quickly bounce back once they have been watered. As with all potted plants, regular repotting once a year will prevent it from becoming root bound.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
