	<p>String of beads is a trailing succulent with thick spherical fleshy leaves that are arranged along its stems. Each shiny light green leaf has a transparent ‘window’ that allows light to penetrate the leaf interior to allow for photosynthesis while minimising water loss.</p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> succulent vine, its long pendulous stems make it an attractive plant for growing in hanging or tall planters.</p>

  <p>String of beads thrive in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-6 hours of indirect sunlight or around 4 hours of direct sun</a>. They are best planted in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">sandy soil</a> around 10-15cm deep, making them suitable for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">container gardening</a>. This plant is vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, and will need soil with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">plenty of grit</a> for good drainage. The leaves of String of Beads can split open if it is suddenly exposed to a lot of water, and is thus best kept out of direct rain, especially during the monsoon season.</p>
