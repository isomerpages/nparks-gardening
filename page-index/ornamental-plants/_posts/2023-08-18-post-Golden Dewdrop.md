	<p>Golden Dewdrops are large, hardy, <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#f">free-flowering</a> shrubs that are commonly seen in roadside gardens, perimeter planting and biodiversity-attracting gardens. The blue nectar-filled flowers are highly attractive bees and butterflies, and the hard, bright yellow fruits are very visually attractive.</p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> shrub, Golden Dewdrops are useful as a <a href="/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants/">biodiversity-attracting plant</a> and perimeter plant to add a pop of colour to any garden.</p>

  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4> 
	<img title="Golden dewdrop plants grown in pots. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/goldendewdrops%20(1)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
  <p>This plant thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-8 hours of direct sunlight</a>. It can also grow in 4-6 hours of indirect sunlight, but at a slower pace with less flowers. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 20cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Golden Dewdrops are a steady grower and does well with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">monthly fertilising with a balanced fertiliser</a>. This shrub can grow up to 2.5m in height but is usually maintained anywhere between 30cm-1.5m tall as small shrubs or hedges. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regular pruning</a> is needed to promote new growth that will keep the plant healthy and neat.</p> 
	<br>

<section> 
  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
	<p>Golden Dewdrops can be grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seed</a> or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">woody stem cuttings</a> with rooting hormone. </p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>If your plant has few to no flowers, you can fertilise the plant with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers high in phosphorus and potassium</a>. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>
	<p>If the plant does not receive enough light, it will stop producing flowers. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Prune</a> surrounding plants or move the plant to a sunnier spot to promote flower growth.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a> and <a href="/page-index/pests/scale-insects/">Scale Insects</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
