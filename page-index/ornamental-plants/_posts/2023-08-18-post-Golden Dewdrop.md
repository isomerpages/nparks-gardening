The blue nectar-filled flowers are highly attractive bees and butterflies, and the hard, bright yellow fruits are very visually attractive.</p>

  <h4>Environmental needs:</h4> 
  <p>This plant thrives in 4-8 hours of direct sunlight. It can also grow in 4-6 hours of indirect sunlight, but at a slower pace with less flowers. Plants do best in loamy soil at least 20cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening, but will rapidly grow to their full size in true ground. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe.</p>

This shrub can grow up to 2.5m in height but is usually maintained anywhere between 30cm-1.5m tall as small shrubs or hedges. Regular pruning is needed to promote new growth that will keep the plant healthy and neat.</p>
