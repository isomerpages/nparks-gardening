	<p>Grasshoppers, Crickets and Katydids are chewing insects with strong hind legs that allow them to hop or jump from plant to plant. They are general feeders, but they prefer young green plants, such as lettuce and beans. Their chewing mouthparts removes large sections of leaves and flowers, sometimes even destroying the whole plant.</p>
	<p>The most common of the three found in Singaporeâ€™s gardens are grasshoppers. Grasshoppers are active during the day and can fly or jump quickly through the garden, meaning that you usually only get a glimpse if they are fleeing.Sometimes, you will see them steadily chewing your plants!</p>
	<p>Grasshopper outbreaks are sporadic as they need drier conditions to hatch. The females deposit their eggs in dry, undisturbed soil, with each clutch ranging from 20 to more than 100 eggs. Young grasshoppers can thus suddenly appear in large numbers during the dry season and rapidly consume your plants!</p>
	<p>Because Singapore is relatively humid, adult grasshoppers generally do not form large swarms to devastate plants like they do in drier climates, particularly during periods of drought.</p>

	<h4>Symptoms</h4>

		<p>Grasshoppers leave behind waxy bite marks with smooth margins. They are not host-specific; hence bite marks can appear on any plant, especially on younger leaves and shoots.</p>

	<h4>Preventive and control measures:</h4>
		<p>Always isolate and inspect newly bought plants for pests before introducing them to your plant collection.</p>
		<p>Isolate affected plants immediately if mealy bugs are found.</p>
		<p>Healthy plants are generally resilient to infestations. If you have a severe pest infestation, check your plants regularly for additional underlying problems such as root rot, lack of sunlight and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
		<p>Spraying horticultural oils such as neem oil or white oil can kill soft-bodied pests on contact.</p>
		<p>Expose infested soil to direct sunlight for at least a month to kill off remaining mealybugs or replace the soil entirely.</p>
		<p>Infested plant parts should be pruned off as soon as possible. Severe infestations may need the entire plant to be removed. Bag up the infested plant or plant parts securely for proper disposal to prevent further spread. Do not use the removed plant waste for composting or for consumption.</p>
