	<p>Garden pests are animals that cause damage to crops or ornamental plants, and can cause frustration for gardeners. However, they are still a part of our natural environment, and care should be taken to manage their impact while keeping the garden a safe place for people and biodiversity. Using integrated pest management techniques with solutions tailored for specific pests is the best way to solve problems over the long term.</p>
	<p>The first step in pest management is to know what pest you are up against. Use our <a href="https://staging.dmhtu0pi4p9u7.amplifyapp.com/digital-tools/pestid/">pest identifier tool</a> to figure out what pests you have!</p>

	<p>Some common garden pests you might see are:</p>

	<h4>Soft-bodied sucking pests</h4>

	<p><a href="https://staging.dmhtu0pi4p9u7.amplifyapp.com/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, mealybugs, and soft scale insects are soft-bodied sucking pests that are found on the stems of plants, sometimes in large numbers. They have piercing mouthparts that they use to drink plant sap, and they produce a sugary substance as a by-product that attracts ants. This sugary substance also encourages the growth of sooty mould on leaves.</p>
	<p>These insects attack plants that have been weakened by other problems like a lack of light, over or underwatering, or root rot. So while it is important to manage their presence on the plant, it is also important to figure why the plant was unhealthy in the first place as well. </p>
	<p>All soft bodied pests can be managed by pruning off the affected plant parts, and using horticultural oils like neem oil to remove the remaining pests. </p>

	<h4>Large chewing pests</h4>

	<p>Caterpillars, grasshoppers, snails and slugs are large pests that use chewing or rasping mouthparts to eat plants. These large pests can be managed with manual removal, or by installing netting around vulnerable plants. </p>

	<h4>"Burrowing" pests</h4>

	<p>Some pests can be found inside plants! Leaf miners and fruit flies will lay their eggs in leaves and fruits respectively, and the hatched larvae will eat these plant parts from the inside. Certain species of beetles can also bore their way into stems of various plants. The only way to manage these pests is to prevent the adults from laying eggs in leaves or fruit by protecting your crops with netting, or by immediately removing infected plant parts.</p>

	<h4>Large animals</h4>
	<p>Some birds and rodents can also be considered pests, especially when they go for fruits and freshly planted seeds. Netting up ripening fruit and germinating vulnerable seedlings in protected areas are the most straightforward method to manage these animals. Reducing the availability of their food sources, like exposed garbage or large fruit peels in compost, will also discourage them from foraging in your garden.</p>
