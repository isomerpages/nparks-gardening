	<p>Spider Mites are microscopic, sap-sucking arachnids that are smaller than aphids. To the naked eye, they usually look like moving dots of various colours â€“ red, yellow, or brown. You will need a 10X handheld lens be able to spot them clearly. They have needle like mouthparts to pierce through plant tissue to feed off the sap.</p>
	<p>They usually live in colonies on the underside of leaves in hot, dry and dusty conditions. Colonies can be identified by spotting the pests among white webbing.  Plants under water stress are highly vulnerable to spider mites. Leafy vegetables such as Bayam, Kangkong and various fruiting vegetables like Brinjal, Chili and Cucumber are susceptible to spider mites during the dry season.</p>
		<p> As with most pests, spider mites generally attack plants that are already unhealthy. Check your plant for additional problems such as root rot from waterlogging, etoilation from a lack of sunlight, or competition with other plants due to a lack of space.  <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/#cultural_control"> Cultural control</a> methods should be implemented to prevent your plants from becoming unhealthy in the first place. </p>

	<h4>Symptoms</h4>

		<p>Spider mites can be found on young shoots and buds, or on the underside of leaves and on fruits. They appear as tiny red dots to the naked eye.</p>
	<p>Affected fruits and leaves may have stippling, which are tiny dots from bite marks.</p>
		<p>Infected leaves may appear bronze or yellow, and curled. Affected fruits may have corky tissue.</p>
	<p>Webbing is usually present on the surface which spider mites are feeding on.</p>

	<h4>Preventive and control measures:</h4>
		<p>Healthy plants are generally resilient to infestations. If you have a severe pest infestation, check your plants regularly for additional underlying problems such as root rot, lack of sunlight and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
	<p>If there are only a few aphids, you can spray them off with water or use a wet cloth to wipe them away.</p>
	<p>Heavily infested plant parts should be pruned off as soon as possible. Severe infestations may need the entire plant to be removed. Bag up the infested plant or plant parts securely for proper disposal to prevent further spread. Do not use the removed plant waste for composting or for consumption.</p>
<p>Horticultural oils and sulphur soap sprays can kill soft-bodied pests on contact. Use <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/#chemical_control">chemical controls</a> like these sparingly as they tend to also affect other types of biodiversity. </p>
		<p>Encourage predators to establish in your garden by keeping it pesticide-free. Ladybirds feed on Spider Mites and can keep their population under control.</p>
