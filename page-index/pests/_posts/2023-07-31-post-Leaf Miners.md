	<p>Leaf miners are tiny greyish flies whose larvae feed under the surface of leaves, creating worm-like tunnels within the leaf.  There are hundreds of species of leaf miners, but the most common leaf miners present in Singapore are <em>Liriomyza sativae</em> (Vegetable leafminer) and <em>Liriomyza trifolii</em> (American serpentine leafminer).</p>

	<p>Most leafy vegetables and fruiting vegetables are susceptible to leaf miner larvae, such as Xiao Bai Cai, Ladyâ€™s Finger and cucumbers.</p>
	<p>Leaf miner damage at a large scale can reduces the amount of light the plant can capture to produce food, which makes them susceptible to plant diseases. Leaves with leaf miner damage also reduces the yield of leafy vegetables since damaged leaves are generally not fit for consumption due to the presence of the larvae in the leaf.</p>

	<h4>Symptoms</h4>

		<p>Infested leaves have translucent, winding trails within the leaf. Severely mined leaves may shrivel and die. </p>

	<h4>Preventive and control measures:</h4>
		<p>Infested plant parts should be pruned off as soon as possible. Severe infestations may need the entire plant to be removed. Bag up the infested plant or plant parts securely for proper disposal to prevent further spread. Do not use the removed plant waste for composting or for consumption.
		</p><p>Netting with very fine mesh can be installed over vulnerable plants.</p>
		<p>Rotation of crops with other types of plants may help to interrupt the insect lifecycle.</p>
		<p>Yellow sticky traps can be placed in the vicinity of the affect plants to catch adult flies, hindering them from reproducing on plants.</p>
