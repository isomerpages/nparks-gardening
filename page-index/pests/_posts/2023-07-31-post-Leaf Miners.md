<p>Leaf miners are tiny greyish flies whose larvae feed under the surface of leaves, creating worm-like tunnels within the leaf.  There are hundreds of species of leaf miners, but the most common leaf miners present in Singapore are Liriomyza sativae (Vegetable leafminer) and Liriomyza trifolii (American serpentine leafminer).</p>
<p>Most leafy vegetables and fruiting vegetables are susceptible to leaf miner larvae, such as Xiao Bai Cai, Ladyâ€™s Finger and cucumbers.</p>
<p>Leaf miner damage at a large scale can reduces the amount of light the plant can capture to produce food, which makes them susceptible to plant diseases. Leaves with leaf miner damage also reduces the yield of leafy vegetables since damaged leaves are generally not fit for consumption due to the presence of the larvae in the leaf.</p>

<h4>Symptoms</h4>
<p>Affected leaves can become skeletonised by the caterpillars, which are voracious feeders in their last stage.</p>

<p>Small faecal pellets can be found in large numbers near leaves that have been eaten.</p>

<p>Rolled up leaves or small pieces of bark bound together with silk might have a caterpillar inside!</p>

<h4>Preventive and control measures:</h4>

<p>Remove caterpillars and eggs by hand as soon as they are spotted. Preschools and primary schools near you may want to adopt them!</p>
<p>A microbial insecticide containing the soil borne bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (BtK) can be applied to the infected plant. Once eaten by the caterpillar, the formulated BtK is broken down into particles that damage the guts of the caterpillar and cause death around a day.</p>

<p>Encourage predators to establish in your garden by keeping it pesticide-free. Wasps, dragonflies and birds feed on caterpillars and can keep their population under control. </p>
