	<p>Plant pests are animals that cause damage to crops or ornamental plants, and can cause frustration for gardeners. However, they are still a part of our natural environment, and care should be taken to manage their impact while keeping the garden a safe place for people and biodiversity. Using <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/ipm/">integrated pest management techniques</a> with solutions tailored for specific pests is the best way to solve problems over the long term.</p>
	<p>The first step in pest management is to know what plant pest you are up against. Use our <a href="https://staging.dmhtu0pi4p9u7.amplifyapp.com/digital-tools/pestid/">plant pest identifier tool</a> to figure out what pests you have!</p>

	<h4>Large animals</h4>

		<img title="A male Pink-necked green pigeon. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Biodiversity/bird_pinkneckgreenpigeon_jacchua.jpg">
			<p>Some birds may eat fruits, grains, and seedlings from your garden, and can do substantial damage if they are in a large flock. Birds are usually seen feeding in the morning. Use <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a> to prevent them from eating your crops.</p>
</div></li>

	<p>Most rodents will emerge at night, with the exception of squirrels, which forage during the day. <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">Netting</a> up ripening fruit and germinating vulnerable seedlings in protected areas are the most straightforward method to manage these animals. Reducing the availability of their food sources, like exposed garbage or large fruit peels in compost, will also discourage them from visiting your garden.</p>
