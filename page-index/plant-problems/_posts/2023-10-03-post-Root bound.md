	<p>All <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">potted plants</a> may eventually get root-bound, in which the roots hit the sides of the pot and start to grow back in towards existing roots or escape through the drainage holes. This is because plants absorb most of their water through new root hairs, or the growing tips of roots. When the growing tips of roots are no longer in contact with moist soil, the plant loses water quickly, which usually results in the plant&nbsp;<a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">wilting</a>&nbsp;suddenly or becoming stunted.

	<h4>Symptoms</h4>
	<p>Plants will <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">wilt</a> suddenly, but will revive after <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/bottom-watering/">bottom watering</a>.</p>
	<p>Plant growth is slow, or the plant stops growing altogether.</p>

	<h4>Treatment</h4>
	<p>Remove the plant from its old pot and tease part the roots before replanting it in a pot at least 10cm larger in diameter and depth with more soil.</p>
