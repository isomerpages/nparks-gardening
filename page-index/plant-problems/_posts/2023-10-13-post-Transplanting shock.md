<p>Transplanting shock happens to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seedlings</a> and <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">cuttings</a> that have been freshly planted into a <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">new pot</a>, planter bed, or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. The change in environment is very stressful for the plant, which causes it to show a number of symptoms that can look very concerning, but will eventually resolve as the plant settles into its new environment.</p>

	<h4>Symptoms</h4>
	<img title="A basil cutting leaves start to turn yellow due to transplanting shock. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plant%20problems/Overwatering_JacChua.jpg">
	<p>Older leaves may turn yellow and drop off. This is normal for transplants as they put more energy into growing more roots and new leaves. This symptom looks similar to the early stages of <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiencies/">nitrogen deficiency</a>, but will not ultimately affect the new leaves.</p>
	<p>Transplants are more prone to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">wilting</a> as the roots take time to establish.</p>

	<h4>Treatment</h4>
	<p><a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering/">Water</a> fresh transplants daily for at least a week until their roots grow in. After a week, water only when the soil is dry.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Prune</a> old and yellowing leaves to help the plant direct more energy into growing new roots, shoots, and leaves.</p>
	<p>Protect fresh transplants with <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">shade netting</a> or in a shaded area with at least <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4 hours of indirect sunlight</a> for a week for the transplant to settle</p>
	<p>Fertilise the transplant with a <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">balanced fertiliser</a> two weeks after transplanting to encourage more growth.</p>
