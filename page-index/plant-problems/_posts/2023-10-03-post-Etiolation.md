	<p>Etiolation is the process in which plants grow long, pale and unhealthy due to the lack of light. Etiolated plants are susceptible to disease and may die quickly due to a lack of energy. </p>
	<p>The word etiolate is thought to have come from the French word “étioler” that referenced depriving celery of light. Plants that are grown in the absence of light or not enough light become pale, have unexpanded leaves, and long weak shoots. The pale appearance is the result of a lack of chlorophyll, the pigment that supports photosynthesis, the primary source of energy in plants.</p>

	<h4>Treatment</h4>
	<p>Knowing how to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/choosing-plants/">choose your plant</a> to fit your environment is the best way to prevent etiolation. The next best way is to move your plant somewhere with more <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">sunlight</a>!</p>
	<p>If you cannot move your plant, you will need to change things in its environment to allow it to get more light. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/plant-spacing/">Thinning</a> and <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> nearby plants will reduce shade, and purchasing <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/grow-lights/">grow lights</a> may be a stopgap measure worth considering. </p>
