	<p>Like people, plants can also get sunburn! Plants that naturally grow in shade, like understory plants, are more likely to suffer from sunburn if they are grown in areas with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">6 or more hours of direct sunlight</a>.

	<h4>Symptoms</h4>
	<img title="Turmeric plants suffering from sunburn. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plant%20problems/turmeric_sunburn_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>Leaf edges or whole leaves will start to turn yellow or white, and the edges of the leaves will turn brown and dry.</p>
	<p>Sun burn is usually also accompanied by <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">wilting</a> from heat stress.</p>

	<h4>Treatment</h4>
	<p>Damaged leaves will not recover. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Prune</a> off damaged leaves and move the plant to a shadier place, or cover it with <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">shade netting</a>. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">Use fertilisers high in nitrogen</a> to encourage the plant to replace the lost leaves.</p>
	<p>Prevention is always better than cure. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/choosing-plants/">Choose plants</a> that are suitable for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">the amount of light you have</a> and prepare hardscapes like <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">shade netting</a> to help reduce the amount of light reaching your plants.</p>
