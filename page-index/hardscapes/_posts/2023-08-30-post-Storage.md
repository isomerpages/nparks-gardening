<p>Keeping tools in dedicated storage spaces will keep your garden neat and extend the life of your tools and garden materials. Bagged compost, fertilisers, pots, seeds, tools, hardscape materials, and pest control materials are just some of the things that should be kept in storage to keep them functional. </p>

<h4>Storage types</h4>
<p>There are many storage systems available on the market, but deciding on the size and type of storage is very much up to each gardenerâ€™s personal taste. Here are some examples of storage to inspire you:</p> 
<img title="" src="">
<p>Garden sheds are best for large gardens or gardens with a lot of common tools and materials. These large storage solutions enable gardens to save money by providing space for items bought in bulk. </p>

<p>Waterproof outdoor cupboards or shelves can also store a variety of materials, but in smaller quantities. Cupboards with doors or drawers provide more protection and look neater, while open shelves are easier to take stock of and are cheaper.</p>

<p>Boxes and in-built storage spaces can be very convenient as they are small enough to be kept close to various gardening areas. They can be used to separate specific tools from general gardening materials or hold personal gardening items like gloves and hats.</p>

<h4>Designating a storage space within your garden</h4>
<img title="" src="">
<p>Figuring out where items should be stored will help you optimize the space in your garden and discourage people from leaving clutter around. Getting to the storage should be easy, with a primary pathway leading to the storage unit itself.</p> 
<p>Storage spaces with relevant tools should ideally be close enough to work areas, for example, having bonsai pruning tools close to the bonsai area of the garden. This will reduce clutter in the general storage area and reduce the chance of specialized tools from getting lost. </p> 
<p>Allotment gardens often come equipped with personal storage units built into the plots, while Community gardens may have a large garden shed placed in a corner for everyone to access. If a large shed is not possible, placing a few cupboards strategically throughout the garden can be considered as an alternative. </p>
