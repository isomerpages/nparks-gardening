	<p>Water points are essential for outdoor gardens and should be one of the first items to be considered when selecting a site. The water point is usually a tap and should be permanent and accessible to all gardeners. Each water point has a serving radius of 7.5m, which is the average length of a hose. Large gardens should build multiple water points to cover the whole planting area to ensure gardeners have access to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering/">water</a>. Wash basins can also serve as water points and are also useful to allow gardeners to wash up after working in the garden.</p>
	<p>New water points need time and money to set up along with, submissions and approvals from the authorities. Whenever possible, try to select sites with existing water points to reduce the cost and time needed to construct your garden.</p> 
	<p><b>Community Gardens on Town Council managed land</b> will need to work with the Town Council itself to secure a water point. Grassroots organisations (e.g., a Resident’s network under the People’s Association) can help to manage this aspect for community groups, but organisations like preschools or senior care centres can contact the Town Council directly. Many void decks, Senior Activity Centres, and community facilities will usually have a water point nearby. If the garden site is not close to an existing water point, a new one will need to be installed by the Town Council. </p>
	<p><b>Community Gardens on NParks managed land</b> will need a Grassroots Organisation to work with their CCC to negotiate the use of an existing water point, or the installation of one with NParks.  Water meters may need to be installed with a lock and key to prevent the misuse of water. </p>
