	<p>Hardscapes are structures that help keep a garden functional, and are the most important part of <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/garden-design/">garden design</a> after site selection. Learning about different kinds of hardscapes is important in helping you choose appropriate materials and structure types, and also helps you to budget space for your garden accordingly.

			<p><a href="/page-index/hardscapes/planter-beds/">Planter beds</a> are usually the main way Community Gardeners grow plants if they are not <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">planting in true ground</a> or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">containers</a>. Planter beds can come in a variety of heights and widths, with a variety of designs for people with different mobility needs to access. </p>

			<p><a href="/page-index/hardscapes/trellises/">Trellises</a> are important structures to mange how vines grow. They can also be permanently placed in a garden to create points of interest, or to provide shade. </p>

			<p><a href="/page-index/hardscapes/staking/">Stakes</a> serve a similar function to trellises in that they also support plants, but they are much smaller and are usually temporary.</p>

			<p><a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">Netting</a> structures are the first line of defense against <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">pests</a>, harsh sun, and heavy rain for vulnerable plants. Dedicating specific parts of the garden for netting and having allowances for the netting structure will make pest and <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seedling</a> management easier. </p>

			<img title="Paths in a Community Garden. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Hardscapes/Pathway_JacChua%20(4).jpg">
			<p><a href="/page-index/hardscapes/pathways/">Pathways</a> are the main way people are going to navigate in a garden, and are thus important in providing accessibility, defining areas, and determining how gardeners can use the space.</p>

    	<label for="accordion5">Shelters</label><div>
			<img title="A shelter in a Community Garden. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Hardscapes/Shelter_JacChua%20(5).jpg">
			<p><a href="/page-index/hardscapes/shelters/">Shelters</a> are an important amenity for gardeners as it provides protection from the weather and a convenient bonding space for communities. They do however take up a large footprint, thus making them better suited for larger gardens.</p>

    	<label for="accordion6">Storage</label><div>
			<img title="A storage shed for gardener's tools. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Hardscapes/Storage_JacChua%20(6).jpg">
			<p><a href="/page-index/hardscapes/storage/">Storage facilities</a> will help to keep a garden neat and functional. Singapore's tropical and humid climate will cause metal to rust, bags to break, and plastic to degrade when exposed to sun and rain. Keeping tools, <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">compost</a>, <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers</a> and <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">pesticides</a> in a storage facility is the cheapest way to prevent wasting these materials!</p>

			<img title="A water point in a Community Garden. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Hardscapes/waterpoint_jacchua_2.jpg">
			<p><a href="/hardscapes/water-points/">Water points</a> are needed within a garden so that gardeners can <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering/">water</a> their plants easily. Standing taps, sinks, and irrigation points are all sources of water that can be used to keep a garden growing well.</p>
