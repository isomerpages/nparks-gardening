	<p>Trellises are support structures made of metal, wood or plastic, that are used as support for climbing plants. Plants such as <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/butterfly-pea/">Butterfly Pea</a>, <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/bitter-gourd/">Bitter Gourd</a> and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/long-bean/">Long Bean</a> have weak stems and tendrils that naturally twirl and climb around nearby structures.  Trellises can support multiple plants, and are best used with plants that naturally climb over each other. If a trellis is tall and wide enough to work as a <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/shelters/">shelter</a> when plants are grown over it, it is called a pergola, and can be used as a focal point within the garden.</p>

	<h4>Trellis materials</h4>
	<p>Different trellis materials will complement your gardenâ€™s design and plant types. Some examples are:</p>
	<img title="Plastic trellis with additional bamboo poles attached on top to increase the surface area for plants to grow on. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Hardscapes/Woodlands%20Botanical%20Garden_20220520%20(32).jpg">
	<p><b>Plastic trellises</b>, which are flexible and light. They generally last between 1-10 years, but prolonged exposure to the sun can make the brittle. Most plastic trellises can be bought at plant nurseries and garden shops, and can also be made from PVC pipes for additional customisation.</p> 
	<img title="A metal trellis made from soldered iron bars. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Hardscapes/PXL_20230225_024732413.jpg">
	<p><b>Metal trellises</b>, which are heavy and resilient. They last between 3-10years, but may be prone to rust if they are not coated with paint or glaze. They also tend to heat up when exposed to a lot of sunlight, which can cause plants to burn. Metal trellises can be made from fencing, wires, metal pipes or poles with soldering.</p> 
	<img title="A wooden trellis made from upcycled wooden poles. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Hardscapes/Trellis%20(5).jpg">
	<p><b>Wooden trellises</b> can be heavy or light, but are also biodegradable and lasts between 3-5years in the tropics, even when coated with resin and other waterproofing materials. Wooden trellises are commonly upcycled from old bedframes, plywood and palette wood.</p>

		<p><b>Bamboo trellises</b> are very flexible and light, but are also not sturdy and will degrade after 1 year if the bamboo is not sealed with plastic or resin. Bamboo tends to snap under weight or in high winds, and thus should only be used for very light climbing plants like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/butterfly-pea/">Butterfly Pea</a> in sheltered gardens with less wind.</p>

	<h4>Trellis shapes</h4>

	<p><b>Arch trellises</b> are great for maximising spaces above walkways or at the entrance of a garden. Plants with fruits that hang down like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/bitter-gourd/">Bitter Gourd</a> are fun options for arch trellises.</p>
	<img title="A teepee trellis made of bamboo. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Hardscapes/teepeetrellis_jacquelinechua-2.jpg">
	<p>A <b>teepee trellis</b> consists of three poles bound at the top, and are a a fast and simple way to make a trellis. This trellis type is ideal for light plants like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/butterfly-pea/">Butterfly Pea</a>.</p>
	<img title="Wall trellises made from metal and rope. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Hardscapes/Trellis%20(3).jpg">
	<p></p><p><b>Wall trellises</b> are ideal for small spaces, and can be used to line the edge of a garden. </p>

	<p></p><p><b>Square or cage trellises</b> can also double up as a <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/staking/">cage stake</a> and are easily constructed in large pots and other small spaces. </p>

	<h4>Safety</h4>
	<p>Trellises should all be stabilised via footing, lashed to supports, or secured with concrete underground. Trellises should be stable enough to endure shaking by people and windy conditions within the garden.</p>

	<p>Some trellis materials like plastic and bamboo may have sharp points or consist of hollow poles. Caps can be used to shield gardeners from points and to prevent water collecting in the poles, which is an important part of <a href="/page-index/housekeeping/keeping-gardens-mosquito-free/">managing mosquitoes in the garden</a>.</p>
