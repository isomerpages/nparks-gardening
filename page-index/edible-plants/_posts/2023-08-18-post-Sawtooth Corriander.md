	<p>Sawtooth Coriander is such a common herb in many gardens that some may even consider it a weed. It tastes like true Coriander (Coriandrum sativum) but is much more tolerant of tropical weather. The leaves have a very strong taste and can be used as a replacement for true coriander in soups and stir-fries.</p>
	<p>Sawtooth Coriander grows as a <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p/">perennial</a> crop in Southeast Asia, but because the leaves get much tougher and less juicy after flowering, it is often cultivated as an <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#a/">annual</a>. It readily flowers and sets seed, making it a useful self-propagating herb that can be used for interplanting or as an edible groundcover. Its shallow root system also makes it <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">a popular choice for pots</a> and corridor gardening.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>Sawtooth Coriander thrives in 4-6 hours of direct sunlight, or at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight. Plants do best in well-drained sandy loam soils at least 10cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening, and corridor gardening. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter and grit to let the roots breathe.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
	<p>Seeds can be scattered directly into pots or true ground. Seeds should sprout within two weeks.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Sawtooth Coriander naturally grows in clusters as mature plants set seed. Thin plants out to give them around 5-10cm of space to encourage larger leaves.</p>
	<p>The leaves of this plant will become tough and less juicy after the plant flowers. Prevent this by regularly removing flower stalks as the plant produces them.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be harvested for leaves at any time. They are typically harvested continuously via the cut-and-come-again method. Regular harvesting will keep the plant productive.</p><p>
	</p><p>Seeds can be harvested from flowers that have developed into dry, black seed capsules.</p>
	<p>Take note that the leaves have sharp edges and may cause skin irritation and cuts. Use gloves when maintaining this plant for safety.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>Like most strong-smelling herbs, this plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>Wilting leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, or move it to a shadier part of the garden.</p>
