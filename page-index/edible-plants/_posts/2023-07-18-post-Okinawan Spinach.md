		<p>This plant grows rapidly in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-8 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. Plants may suffer from <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">sunburn</a> in more than 4 hours of direct sunlight. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">sandy soil</a> at least 10cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
		<p>Okinawan Spinach grows rapidly when young and freshly planted from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">cuttings</a>. Regular harvesting will encourage the plant to grow more leaves and stems.</p>
		<p>This plant generally does not require fertilising, but it can be fed with a high nitrogen fertiliser once a month to encourage growth after <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again/">cut-and-come-again harvesting</a>.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
		<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for young leaves at any time. They are typically harvested continuously via the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again/">cut-and-come-again</a> method.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
		<p>Okinawan Spinach is typically propagated via <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">stem cuttings</a> in soil. Cuttings rooted in water are likely to rot.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
		<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>Smaller plants may be vulnerable to being eaten by <a href="/page-index/pests/snails-and-slugs/">snails and slugs</a>. Protect your plants with a DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches">cloche</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting">netting</a>.</p>
			<p>These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">sunburn</a> in more than 4 hours of direct sunlight. Use <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">shade netting</a> to protect your plants or replant in a shadier spot.</p>
				<p>This plant is especially vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a> caused by <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogging</a>. It is best to grow the plant in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy or sandy soil</a> with plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">soil amendments</a> to prevent this.</p>
