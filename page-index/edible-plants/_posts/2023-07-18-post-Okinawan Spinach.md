Plants may suffer from <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">sunburn</a> in more than 4 hours of direct sunlight. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy or sandy soil</a> at least 10cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe.</p>
