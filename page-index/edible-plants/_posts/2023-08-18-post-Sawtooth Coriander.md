	<p>Sawtooth Coriander is such a common herb in many gardens that some may even consider it a weed. It tastes like true Coriander (<em>Coriandrum sativum</em>) but is much more tolerant of tropical weather. The leaves have a very strong taste and can be used as a replacement for true coriander in soups and stir-fries.</p>
	<p>Sawtooth Coriander grows as a <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop in Southeast Asia, but because the leaves get much tougher and less juicy after flowering, it is often cultivated as an <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#a">annual</a>. It readily flowers and sets seed, making it a useful self-propagating herb that can be used for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/plant-spacing/">interplanting</a> or as a <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/companion-planting/">living mulch</a>. Its shallow root system also makes it a popular choice for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">growing in pots</a>.</p>

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
	<p>Sawtooth Coriander thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-6 hours of direct sunlight, or at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">sandy or loamy soil</a> at least 5cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic and inorganic soil amendments</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
	<p><a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">Seeds can be scattered directly</a> into pots or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. Seeds should sprout within two weeks.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<img title="Flowering sawtooth coriander growing in pots. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/sawtoothcoriander3_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>Sawtooth Coriander naturally grows in clusters as mature plants set seed. Thin plants out to give them around 5-10cm of space to encourage larger leaves.</p>
	<p>The leaves of this plant will become tough and less juicy after the plant flowers. Prevent this by regularly removing flower stalks as the plant produces them.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for leaves at any time. They are typically harvested continuously via the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again/">cut-and-come-again method</a>. Regular harvesting will keep the plant productive.</p><p>
	</p><p>Seeds can be harvested from flowers that have developed into dry, black seed capsules.</p>
	<p><b>Take note that the leaves have sharp edges and may cause skin irritation and cuts. Use gloves when maintaining this plant for safety.</b></p>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Sawtooth Coriander can be grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seed</a> or propagated via <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">division</a>.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>Like most strong-smelling herbs, this plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting leaves</a> during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, or move it to a shadier part of the garden.</p>
