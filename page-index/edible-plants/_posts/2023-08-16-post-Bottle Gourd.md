	<h3>Bottle Gourd (<em>Lagenaria siceraria</em>)</h3>

	<p>Bottle Gourds are an hourglass-shaped fruit that have edible flesh and seeds. Young fruit and seeds are fried, stewed, boiled, or steamed in a variety of Chinese and Indian dishes. Mature fruit have very hard skin, which can then be dried and processed into containers and musical instruments.</p> 
	<p>An annual crop, these plants are often grown in rotation with other fruiting climbers.</p>
	<p>This plant is part of the Cucurbita or Melon family, which includes other popular edible fruits like Cucumber, Winter melon, and Pumpkin.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
		<img src="/images/Plants/Tomato_JacChua%20(3).jpg">
	<p>This vine does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight. This plant can also grow in areas with at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but growth will be slower, and the vine will produce less fruit.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 30cm deep, or in true ground. The plant can be grown in smaller pots about 20cm deep, but growth will be slower due to the lack of water retention in less soil and a smaller root ball.</p>
	<p>As a fast-growing vine, this plant needs a sturdy trellis to scramble on. Because the fruits hang down, it is ideal for arch-shaped trellises.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
<p>Sow seeds individually in a seedling tray filled with potting mix or seedling mix. Lightly mist the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within two weeks.</p>

<p>The seedlings will be vulnerable to high heat and heavy rain and are best kept in a sheltered propagation area or a shaded space with around 4 hours of partial or direct sunlight. </p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Transplanting:</h4>
<p>Seedlings will be ready for transplanting into pots or true ground when they have developed 4 or more leaves, or roughly a week or two after germination. Leave 15-30cm between each plant to encourage more growth and better ventilation. </p>
<br>
	</section>
	
<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
<p>Tomatoes will produce more flowers and thus more fruit when fed with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. Plants can be fertilised regularly a month after germination for a fuller crop. </p>
<p>For both vining and shrub varieties, it is a good practice to prune regularly and remove dead leaves and stems to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant. Regular pruning also decreases the likelihood of pests quickly taking over the plant. Suckers can be removed as part of regular pruning and propagated via divison.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Plants can be harvested for fruits around three months after sowing. The best time to harvest the fruit is in the early morning, before 9am.</p>
<p>Tomatoes are generally harvested when ripe, however unripe tomatoes can also be eaten after they have been thoroughly cooked. Ripe tomatoes are shiny, glossy, and will no longer have green spots. They should be easy to pop off the stem with a gentle twist. Seeds can be used from ripe fruit for immediate planting.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Tomatoes are grown from seed or via division of suckers. </p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p>If your plant has little to no flowers, you try fertilising the plant with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>
<p>This plant is buzz-pollinated by bees. If you have a lot of flowers and no fruit, you may need to attract bees to your garden by growing some pollinator-attracting plants.</p>  
<p>Fruits can be vulnerable to blossom end rot, which shows up as dark blotches on the ends of fruit. To prevent this, make sure that the soil is constantly moist by not waterlogged through regular watering.</p>
<p>Fruits might crack if the plant is exposed to a lot of water suddenly, like during the first rain of the monsoon season. Protect your plants with a shelter and manage watering by hand, or via an irrigation system.</p>
<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p> 
<p>Fruit flies can lay eggs in the fruit, resulting in larvae damaging the fruit and creating spots on the skin. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off. </p>
<p>This plant is susceptible to root-knot nematodes which cause the plant to have galls on its roots which result in leaf wilting and root decay. Rotate your crops and change the soil to remedy the infestation. </p>
<p>Wilting leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss. </p>
<p>This plant is vulnerable to both heat stress and root rot. Both can be mitigated by having well-drained soil mix that is watered regularly, particularly during the dry season or in exposed gardens.</p>
