	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
	<img title="Javan Spinach flowers. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/javanspinach_flowers_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>This plant needs <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">about 4-8 hours of direct sunlight</a>, or at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 10cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe. Keep your plants cool with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">mulch</a> and plenty of water to encourage growth.</p>

	<h4>Seed Sowing:</h4>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within two weeks.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Waterleaf is a rapid grower and generally does not need fertiliser, but it can be fed with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">high nitrogen fertilisers</a> once a month to encourage leaf growth. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regular pruning</a> will encourage additional growth and improve air circulation.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for both older and younger leaves at any time but are typically harvested 2 months after sowing every 2 weeks for up to 6 months. They are typically harvested continuously via the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again/">cut-and-come-again method</a>.</p>
	<p>Seeds can be harvested for immediate planting when fruit pods are brown and dry.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Waterleaf can be grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seed</a>, but they are usually propagated <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">via stem cuttings</a> in soil or water.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, or move it to a shadier part of the garden.</p>
