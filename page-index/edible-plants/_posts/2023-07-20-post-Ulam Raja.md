	<p>Ulam Raja are large bushy plants with edible leaves that are eaten raw and are a key ingredient in Nasi Ulam, a rice salad eaten in Southeast Asia. The plant also produces small pink flowers that attract a variety of butterflies and bees.</p>
	<p>This large <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#a">annual</a> shrub produces many small wind-dispersed seeds that sprout quickly, which usually results in seedlings spontaneously growing around the garden. This makes it a popular choice for edible gardens, that practice <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/crop-rotation/">crop rotation</a>.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<img title="Ulam Raja flower. Photo by Victoria Lim." src="/images/Plants/ulamraja_victorialim.jpg">
	<p>Ulam Raja grows well in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">6-8 hours of direct sunlight</a>. They can also be grown in more than 4 hours of direct sunlight or more than 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but will produce less leaves and flowers. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 20cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>

	<p><a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagation-by-seeds">Sow seeds</a>  individually in a seedling tray filled with potting mix or seedling mix. Lightly mist the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 10 days.</p>
	<p>The seedlings will be vulnerable to high heat and heavy rain and are best kept in a sheltered propagation area or a shaded space with around 4 hours of partial or direct sunlight.</p>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 10 days.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Transplanting:</h4>
	<p>Seedlings will be ready for transplanting into pots or true ground when they have developed 4 or more leaves, or roughly a week or two after germination. Leave 15cm between each plant to encourage more growth and better ventilation.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Ulam Raja plants grow rapidly, especially with regular harvesting and the use of high nitrogen fertilisers will encourage the plant to grow more leaves. Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilised</a> once every two weeks after transplanting, or after hard pruning.</p>
	<p>Ulam Raja plants will die after producing seeds. Prolong your harvest by pinching off flowers when they appear.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<img title="Ulam raja leaves. Photo by Jacqueline Chua" src="/images/Plants/ulamraja%20(2)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for young or old leaves at any time.</p>
		<img title="Photo by Jacqueline Chua" src="/images/Plants/UlamRaja_JacChua.jpg">
	<p>Fruits can be harvested for seeds when they are brown and dry.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Ulam Raja can be grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagation-by-seeds">seed</a>.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
		<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting">Wilting</a> may occur during periods of hot weather or from the lack of watering. Regular wilting will stunt plant growth. Increase the number of times a plant is watered, or use <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching">mulch</a> to retain moisture in the soil.</p>
