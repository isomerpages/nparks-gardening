	<p>Ulam Raja are large bushy plants with edible leaves that are eaten raw and are a key ingredient in Nasi Ulam, a rice salad eaten in Southeast Asia. The plant also produces small pink flowers that attract a variety of butterflies and bees.</p>
	<p>This large <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#a">annual</a> shrub produces many small wind-dispersed seeds that sprout quickly, with plants quickly growing around the garden. This makes it a popular choice for edible gardens, biodiversity-attracting gardens and low-maintenance beds.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>Ulam Raja grows well in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">6-8 hours of direct sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 20cm deep, or in true ground. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
	<p>Sow seeds individually in a seedling tray filled with potting mix or seedling mix. Lightly mist the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 10 days.</p>

	<br>
	<p>The seedlings will be vulnerable to high heat and heavy rain and are best kept in a sheltered propagation area or a shaded space with around 4 hours of partial or direct sunlight.</p>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 10 days.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Transplanting:</h4>
	<p>Seedlings will be ready for transplanting into pots or true ground when they have developed 4 or more leaves, or roughly a week or two after germination. Leave 15cm between each plant to encourage more growth and better ventilation.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Ulam Raja plants grow rapidly, especially with regular harvesting and the use of high nitrogen fertilisers will encourage the plant to grow more leaves. Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilised</a> once every two weeks after transplanting, or after hard pruning.</p>
	<p>Ulam Raja plants will die after producing seeds. Prolong your harvest by pinching off flowers when they appear.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<img title="Photo by Jacqueline Chua" src="/images/Plants/UlamRaja_JacChua.jpg">
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for leaves at any time.  Fruits can be harvested for seeds when they are brown and dry.</p>

	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs">mealy bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning">Regularly prune</a> the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot">root rot</a>, lack of sunlight, and <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiencies">nutrient deficiencies</a>.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting">Wilting</a> may occur during periods of hot weather or from the lack of watering. Regular wilting will stunt plant growth. Increase the number of times a plant is watered, or use <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching">mulch</a> to retain moisture in the soil.</p>
