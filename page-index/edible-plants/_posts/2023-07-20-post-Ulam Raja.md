	<h3>Ulam Raja (<em>Cosmos caudatus</em>)</h3>
</header>
	
<section>
	<p><strong>Other common names:</strong> Wild Cosmos, Cosmos, Ulam Raja, Pelampong, 帝皇乌蓝</p>

<section>
<p>Ulam Raja are large bushy plants with edible leaves that are eaten raw and are a key ingredient in Nasi Ulam, a rice salad eaten in Southeast Asia. The plant also produces small pink flowers that attract a variety of butterflies and bees. </p>
<p>This large annual shrub produces many small wind-dispersed seeds that sprout quickly, with plants quickly growing around the garden. This makes it a popular choice for edible gardens, biodiversity-attracting gardens and low-maintenance beds.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
<p>Ulam Raja grows well in 6-8 hours of direct sunlight. Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 20cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
<p>Sow seeds individually in a seedling tray filled with potting mix or seedling mix. Lightly mist the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 10 days.</p>

<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY cloche or netting. </p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
<p>Bean plants generally don’t require much fertilising because they are able to fix their own nitrogen. </p>
<p>Because the vines will grow on top of each other, it is a good practice to <a href="https://staging.dmhtu0pi4p9u7.amplifyapp.com/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune regularly</a> and remove dead leaves and vines to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant. </p>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Plants can be harvested for flowers at any time.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p><a href="https://staging.dmhtu0pi4p9u7.amplifyapp.com/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. <a href="https://staging.dmhtu0pi4p9u7.amplifyapp.com/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Prune off</a> the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies. </p>
<p>Whiteflies can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray. </p>
<p>Wilting leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss. </p>
