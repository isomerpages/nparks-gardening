	<p>Tomatoes are a popular crop grown in home and Community Gardens and are often considered one of the most desirable crops for new gardeners to try. There are many Tomato cultivars, with the most common varieties seen in Singapore being heat- and rain-tolerant cherry tomato varieties. Tomatoes are usually red but can also come in other colours like yellow or pink, and range in shape and size depending on the <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#c/">cultivar</a>.</p>
	<p>Immature tomatoes can be eaten after they have been cooked, with the most common methods being frying or making them into chutney. Ripe Tomatoes can be eaten raw, in soup, roasted or made into sauces.</p>
	<p>As an <a href="/page-index/glossary/#a">annual</a> crop, these plants do well as part of scheduled <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/crop-rotation/">crop rotation</a>.</p>
	<p>This plant is part of the Solanum or Nightshade family, which includes other popular edible fruits like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/brinjal/">Brinjals</a> and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/chilli/">Chillies</a>.</p>

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
	<img src="/images/Plants/Tomato_JacChua%20(3).jpg">
	<p>This vine does best in full sun gardens with a <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">minimum of 6 hours of direct sunlight</a>. This plant can also grow with 4-5 hours of direct sunlight and at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but will produce less fruits.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy or sandy soil</a> at least 15cm deep. They are usually grown in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a>, but they can also be grown in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a> that has been heavily amended with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic soil amendments</a>.</p>

	<p>Depending on the cultivar, tomatoes can grow as a vine (indeterminate) or as a small shrub (determinate). Vining varieties will need <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/staking/">stakes</a> or a <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/trellises/">trellis</a> to support their growth.</p>
	<p>As with all members of the Nightshade family, this plant is buzz-pollinated and produces the most fruit when bees are around to pollinate it. Growing more <a href="/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants/">bee-attracting plants</a> within the garden will encourage pollination.  </p>
	<p> Tomato plants need to be watered consistently, and have good soil drainage. Plants in <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogged soil</a> or pots with poor drainage tend to get <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a> easily, resulting in the plant dying quickly. Tomatoes exposed to a lot of water suddenly, like during the first storm of the monsoon season, may have their fruits crack. Plants that lack water or are <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering/">inconsistently watered</a> tend to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">wilt</a>, particularly at the hottest part of the day, and may get <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiencies/">blossom end rot</a>. Blossom end rot looks like dark, sunken patches at the end of fruits, and is a symptom of a lack of calcium. Most soils in Singapore have plenty of calcium, but a lack of water will prevent it from reaching the fruit.</p>
	<p>All of these watering-related problems can be managed by planting tomatoes in well-draining soil with plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter like compost and cocopeat</a>. This is because organic matter soaks water up like a sponge, but will allow excess water to drain away, thus making sure that the roots can breathe and prevents root rot. With such well-draining soil, the plants can then be watered by hand or via an irrigation system twice a day to keep the soil moist, and the plant well-watered. Plants grown during the monsoon season can be protected by a <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/shelters/">shelter</a> to prevent the large influx of water during storms from cracking fruits.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
	<p>Sow seeds individually in a seedling tray filled with potting mix or seedling mix. Lightly mist the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within two weeks.</p>
	<iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7J87wY7U6s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>	<br>
	<p>The seedlings will be vulnerable to high heat and heavy rain and are best kept in a sheltered propagation area or a shaded space with around 4 hours of partial or direct sunlight. </p>

	<h4>Transplanting:</h4>
	<img title="A tomato seedling being transplanted into a bigger pot. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Horti%20techniques/tomatotransplanting%20(3)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>Seedlings will be ready for transplanting into pots or true ground when they have developed 4 or more leaves, or roughly a week or two after germination. Leave 15-30cm between each plant to encourage more growth and better ventilation. </p>
	<br>
</section>
	
<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Tomatoes will produce more flowers and thus more fruit when fed with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium</a>. Plants can be fertilised regularly a month after germination for a fuller crop. </p>
	<p>For both vining and shrub varieties, it is a good practice to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune regularly</a> and remove dead leaves and stems to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant. Regular pruning also decreases the likelihood of pests quickly taking over the plant. Suckers can be removed as part of regular pruning and propagated via division.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<img title="Tomatoes in various stages of ripening. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/Tomato_JacChua%20(5).jpg">
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene">harvested</a> for fruits around three months after sowing. The best time to harvest the fruit is in the early morning, before 9am.</p>
	<p>Tomatoes can be harvested slightly mature, when they start to flush their final colour, or completely mature, when they no longer have green spots. Immature tomatoes can be eaten after they have been thoroughly cooked. Immature tomatoes can also be left in a cool, dry place to complete the ripening process. Mature tomatoes are shiny, glossy, and will no longer have green spots. They should be easy to pop off the stem with a gentle twist. Seeds can be used from mature fruit for immediate planting.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Tomatoes are grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seed</a> or via <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">cuttings</a> rooted in water. </p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p>If your plant has few to no flowers, you can fertilise the plant with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers high in phosphorus and potassium</a>. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>
	<p>Many plants require <a href="/page-index/biodiversity/pollinators/">pollinators</a> to help them fruit. Bees, butterflies, birds and even beetles transport pollen from one flower to another, pollinating your crops and increasing their fruit yield. Attract some pollinators to your garden by growing <a href="/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants/">pollinator-attracting plants</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs">mealy bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/scale-insects/">scale insects</a> often infest the plant if it is <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogged</a>, <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">wilted from heat stress</a>, or is <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering/">inconsistently watered</a>. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/oriental-fruit-flies">Fruit flies</a> can lay eggs in the fruit, resulting in larvae damaging the fruit and creating spots on the skin. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off. </p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching">mulch</a> at the base to prevent water loss. </p>
	<p>These plants can get <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiencies/">blossom end rot</a>, which shows up as dark, sunken blotches at the end of fruits. It is a symptom of a lack of calcium reaching the fruit, which is usually caused by a lack of water or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering/">inconsistent watering</a>. Keep your soil moist but not waterlogged and take care to water more often during the dry season.</p>
