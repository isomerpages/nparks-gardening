<p>Tomatoes are a popular crop grown in home and Community Gardens and are often considered one of the most desirable crops for new gardeners to try. There are many Tomato cultivars, with the most common varieties seen in Singapore being heat-tolerant cherry tomato varieties. Tomatoes are usually red but can also come in other colours like yellow or pink, and range in shape and size depending on the cultivar.</p>
<p>Immature tomatoes can be eaten after they have been cooked, with the most common methods being frying or making them into chutney. Ripe Tomatoes can be eaten raw, in soup, roasted or made into sauces.</p>
<p>As an annual crop, these plants do well as part of scheduled crop rotation.</p>
<p>This plant is part of the Solanum or Nightshade family, which includes other popular edible fruits like Brinjals and Chillies.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>

<p>This vine does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of direct sunlight. This plant can also grow with 4-5 hours of direct sunlight and at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but will produce less fruits.</p>
<p>Plants do best in <a href="https://staging.dmhtu0pi4p9u7.amplifyapp.com/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 15cm deep, or in true ground.</p>

<p>Depending on the cultivar, tomatoes can grow as a vine (indeterminate) or as a small shrub (determinate). Vining varieties will need stakes or a trellis to support their growth.</p>
<p>As with all members of the Nightshade family, this plant is buzz-pollinated and produces the most fruit when bees are around to pollinate it. Growing more bee-attracting plants within the garden will encourage pollination. It can be hand-pollinated, but the success rate is generally lower. </p>
	<p> Tomato plants need to be watered consistently, and have good soil drainage. Plants in waterlogged soil or pots with poor drainage tend to get root rot easily, resulting in the plant dying quickly. Tomatoes exposed to a lot of water suddenly, like during the first storm of the monsoon season, may have their fruits crack. Plants that lack water or are watered inconsistently tend to wilt, particularly at the hottest part of the day, and may get blossom end rot. Blossom end rot looks like dark, sunken patches at the end of fruits, and is a symptom of a lack of calcium. Most soils in Singapore have plenty of calcium, but a lack of water will prevent it from reaching the fruit.</p>
	<p>All of these watering-related problems can be managed by planting tomatoes in well-draining soil with plenty of organic matter like compost and cocopeat. This is because organic matter soaks water up like a sponge, but will allow excess water to drain away, thus making sure that the roots can breathe and prevents root rot. With such well-draining soil, the plants can then be watered by hand or via an irrigation system twice a day to keep the soil moist, and the plant well-watered. Plants grown during the monsoon season can be protected by a shelter to prevent the large influx of water during storms from cracking fruits.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
<p>Sow seeds individually in a seedling tray filled with potting mix or seedling mix. Lightly mist the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within two weeks.</p>
	
<iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7J87wY7U6s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>	<br>

<p>The seedlings will be vulnerable to high heat and heavy rain and are best kept in a sheltered propagation area or a shaded space with around 4 hours of partial or direct sunlight. </p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Transplanting:</h4>
<p>Seedlings will be ready for transplanting into pots or true ground when they have developed 4 or more leaves, or roughly a week or two after germination. Leave 15-30cm between each plant to encourage more growth and better ventilation. </p>
<br>
	</section>
	
<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
<p>Tomatoes will produce more flowers and thus more fruit when fed with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. Plants can be fertilised regularly a month after germination for a fuller crop. </p>
<p>For both vining and shrub varieties, it is a good practice to prune regularly and remove dead leaves and stems to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant. Regular pruning also decreases the likelihood of pests quickly taking over the plant. Suckers can be removed as part of regular pruning and propagated via divison.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Plants can be harvested for fruits around three months after sowing. The best time to harvest the fruit is in the early morning, before 9am.</p>
<p>Tomatoes are generally harvested when ripe, however unripe tomatoes can also be eaten after they have been thoroughly cooked. Ripe tomatoes are shiny, glossy, and will no longer have green spots. They should be easy to pop off the stem with a gentle twist. Seeds can be used from ripe fruit for immediate planting.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Tomatoes are grown from seed or via division of suckers. </p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p>If your plant has little to no flowers, you try fertilising the plant with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>
<p>This plant is buzz-pollinated by bees. If you have a lot of flowers and no fruit, you may need to attract bees to your garden by growing some pollinator-attracting plants.</p>  
<p>Fruits can be vulnerable to blossom end rot, which shows up as dark blotches on the ends of fruit. To prevent this, make sure that the soil is constantly moist by not waterlogged through regular watering.</p>
<p>Fruits might crack if the plant is exposed to a lot of water suddenly, like during the first rain of the monsoon season. Protect your plants with a shelter and manage watering by hand, or via an irrigation system.</p>
<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p> 
<p>Fruit flies can lay eggs in the fruit, resulting in larvae damaging the fruit and creating spots on the skin. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off. </p>
<p>This plant is susceptible to root-knot nematodes which cause the plant to have galls on its roots which result in leaf wilting and root decay. Rotate your crops and change the soil to remedy the infestation. </p>
<p>Wilting leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss. </p>
<p>This plant is vulnerable to both heat stress and root rot. Both can be mitigated by having well-drained soil mix that is watered regularly, particularly during the dry season or in exposed gardens.</p>
