<p>Torch Gingers are an iconic edible flower that are a key ingredient in Rojak, a Southeast Asian salad. The unopened flowers are eaten raw, in stir fries, in sauces and in stews.  
Mature flowers are bright, showy, and long lasting, making them suitable as a cut flower. Mature flowers also attract nectivorous birds and can be used in biodiversity-attracting gardens.</p>
	<p>It is a large <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop that grows rapidly in the tropics. This is a common plant in herb gardens, permaculture gardens, and low maintenance beds. </p>
<p>Torch Gingers are part of the Zingiberaceae or Ginger family, which includes other popular edible plants like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/turmeric/">Turmeric</a> and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/fingerroot/">Fingerroot</a>.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>Torch Gingers thrive in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">4-8 hours of direct sunlight, or 6-8 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 30cm deep, making them best suited for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground planting</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your soil drains well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>
	<p>This plant will not do well in places with a lot of wind, like on rooftop gardens. Protect the plant with other larger plants nearby to block off the wind. </p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Torch gingers grow naturally in clusters as the plant grows more rhizome, an underground horizontal stem that resembles a tuberous root. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning">Regular pruning</a> and thinning plants will increase airflow and reduce the incidence of pests.  </p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for immature flowers at any time. </p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Torch gingers are propagated via <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">division of the rhizome</a>.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering">watered</a> daily, or move it to a shadier part of the garden.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs">mealy bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning">Regularly prune</a> the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot">root rot</a>, lack of sunlight, and <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot">nutrient deficiencies</a>.</p>
