	<p>Torch Gingers are an iconic edible flower that are a key ingredient in Rojak, a Southeast Asian salad. The unopened flowers are eaten raw, in stir fries, in sauces and in stews.  
Mature flowers are bright, showy, and long lasting, making them suitable as a cut flower. Mature flowers also attract <a href="/page-index/biodiversity/pollinators/">nectivorous birds</a> and can be used in <a href="/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants">biodiversity-attracting gardens</a>.</p>
	<p>It is a large <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop that grows rapidly in the tropics. This is a common plant in shady edible gardens, and is usually grown in true ground. </p>
	<p>Torch Gingers are part of the Zingiberaceae or Ginger family, which includes other popular edible plants like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/turmeric/">Turmeric</a> and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/fingerroot/">Fingerroot</a>.</p>

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
	<p>Torch Gingers thrive in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-8 hours of direct sunlight, or 6-8 hours of indirect sunlight</a>.</p>
	<p> Plants do best in  <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 30cm deep in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your soil drains well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>
	<p>This plant will not do well in places with a lot of wind, like on rooftop gardens. Protect the plant with other larger plants nearby to block off the wind. </p>

<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Torch gingers grow naturally in clusters as the plant grows more <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#r">rhizome</a>, an underground horizontal stem that resembles a tuberous root. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regular pruning</a> and thinning plants will increase airflow and reduce the incidence of pests.  </p>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for immature flowers at any time. </p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Torch gingers are propagated via <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">division of the rhizome</a>.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>If your plant has few to no flowers, you can fertilise the plant with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers high in phosphorus and potassium</a>. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering/">watered</a> daily, or move it to a shadier part of the garden.</p>
<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like root rot. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
