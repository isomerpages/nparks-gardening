<p>Torch Gingers are an iconic edible flower that are a key ingredient in Rojak, a Southeast Asian salad. The unopened flowers are eaten raw, in stir fries, in sauces and in stews.  
Mature flowers are bright, showy, and long lasting, making them suitable as a cut flower. Mature flowers also attract nectivorous birds and can be used in biodiversity-attracting gardens.</p>
	<p>It is a large <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop that grows rapidly in the tropics. This is a common plant in herb gardens, permaculture gardens, and low maintenance beds. </p>
<p>Torch Gingers are part of the Zingiberaceae or Ginger family, which includes other popular edible plants like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/turmeric/">Turmeric</a> and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/fingerroot/">Fingerroot</a>.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>Torch Gingers thrive in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">4-8 hours of direct sunlight, or 6-8 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 30cm deep, making them best suited for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground planting</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your soil drains well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>
	<p>This plant will not do well in places with a lot of wind, like on rooftop gardens. Protect the plant with other larger plants nearby to block off the wind. </p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Taro grows rapidly in the rainy season and has the potential to overwhelm neighbouring plants. Its large size and rapid growth make it a good filler plant for parts of the garden with <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogged soil</a> or that are prone to flooding. Grow Taro in its own garden bed or in a designated area for ease of maintenance. </p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene">harvested</a> for tubers and young leaflets at any time but will need at least 4 to 10 months to produce additional tubers after being planted.  The tubers are typically harvested via division, while young leaves are harvested via the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again">cut-and-come-again method</a>.</p>
	<p><b>The tubers and leaves should not be eaten raw as they contain calcium oxalate, which is toxic.</b>The calcium oxalate is destroyed by cooking with heat.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Taro is propagated <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division">via division</a> of the tubers. </p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering">watered</a> daily, or move it to a shadier part of the garden.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs">mealy bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning">Regularly prune</a> the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot">root rot</a>, lack of sunlight, and <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot">nutrient deficiencies</a>.</p>
