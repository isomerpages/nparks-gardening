	<p>A staple in many Southeast Asian gardens, Curry Leaf Plants thrive in full sun gardens and can quickly grow up to 2.5m in height. Their leaves produce highly aromatic oils that give curry its distinctive taste, and can be dried and powdered, fried, or boiled. </p>
	<p>A large <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop, curry leaf trees are usually planted in true ground. </p>
	<p>Curry leaf plants are part of the Rutaceae or Rue family, which includes other popular edible plants like Limes and Limau Purut. </p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>Curry Leaf Plants need <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">at least 6 hours of direct sunlight</a> to flourish. They can also grow in 4-6 hours of direct sunlight or in more than 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but the plant will be leggy and less lush.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 30cm deep, or in true ground. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot">root rot</a>, so ensure that your soil drains well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe.</p>
	<p>This tree can grow up to 2.5m high, but it can be pruned down to a around 1.5m for easy maintenance.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 30cm-1m apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout around two weeks.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Curry trees are rapid growers and will need regular pruning to be maintained at manageable height. Because they already grow rapidly, they generally do not require <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising">fertilising</a>, but a use of a high nitrogen fertiliser after <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning">hard pruning</a> will encourage the plant to bounce back quickly. </p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be harvested for leaves at any time. Regular harvesting will encourage bushier growth and will keep the plant at a manageable height. </p>
<p>Mature, black fruits can be harvested for seeds. Sow seeds from ripe fruit immediately after harvesting as they tend to rot quickly.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Curry Leaf Plants can be grown from seed or propagated via woody stem cuttings. Woody stem cuttings should be dipped in rooting hormone before being potted up in rooting media. </p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>Like most strong-smelling herbs, this plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
<p>This plant is vulnerable to fungal diseases that form leaf spots during the wet season or when the plant is overgrown. Increase air circulation with regular pruning and remove affected leaves to reduce the spread.</p>
<p>Aphids, may infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
