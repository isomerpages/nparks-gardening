	<p>Roselles are a popular fruiting shrub that produces a striking red calyx that is edible. The calyx refers to the sepals surrounding the hard and inedible seed pod, and can be made into drinks, jams, or dried for direct consumption. The young shoots are also edible and can be added to salads and soups.</p>
	<p>As large and woody <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> bush, this plant is a staple in edible gardens.</p>
  <p>This plant is part of the Malvaceae or Hibiscus family, which includes other edible plants like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/ladys-finger/">Lady’s-Finger</a>, and ornamental plants like <a href="/page-index/ornamental-plants/turks-turban/"> Turk's Turban</a>.

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
		<img src="/images/Plants/Roselle_JacChua.jpg">
		<p>This plant does best in full sun gardens with a <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">minimum of 6 hours of sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 20cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>.</p>
		<p>This vine is vulnerable to heat stress during the dry season. Water it regularly and <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">mulch</a> the base to prevent water loss.</p>
	<p>As a fast-growing vine, this plant needs to be trained up a light <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/trellises/">trellis</a>. The vine readily produces flowers and can be used to beautify fences and arch trellises.</p>
		<p>As with all members of the bean family, this plant is pollinated by bees. Growing more <a href="/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants/">bee-attracting plants</a> within the garden will encourage pollination.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
	<p><a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">Seeds can be sown directly</a> into pots or the ground around 15cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 10 days.</p>

		<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches/">cloche</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a>.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
		<p>Bean plants generally don’t require much fertilising because they are able to fix their own nitrogen.</p>
		<p>Because the vines will grow on top of each other, it is a good practice to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune regularly</a> and remove dead leaves and vines to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
		<p>Plants can be harvested for flowers at any time.</p>

		<p>Dry, brown seed pods are mature, and can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">harvested for seeds</a> to plant.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
		<p>This vine can be grown via <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seeds</a>. Seeds can be taken from mature fruit for immediate planting.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>If your vine has few to no flowers, you can fertilise the plant with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers high in phosphorus and potassium</a>.</p>
		<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">Spider Mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss.</p>
