	<p>Roselles are a popular fruiting shrub that produces a striking red calyx that is edible. The calyx refers to the sepals surrounding the hard and inedible seed pod, and can be made into drinks, jams, or dried for direct consumption. The young shoots are also edible and can be added to salads and soups.</p>
	<p>As large and woody <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> bush, this plant is a staple in edible gardens.</p>
  <p>This plant is part of the Malvaceae or Hibiscus family, which includes other edible plants like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/ladys-finger/">Lady’s-Finger</a>, and ornamental plants like <a href="/page-index/ornamental-plants/turks-turban/"> Turk's Turban</a>.

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
		<img src="/images/Plants/Roselle_JacChua.jpg">
		<p>This plant does best in full sun gardens with a <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">minimum of 6 hours of sunlight</a>. It can also grow in gardens with more than 4 hours of direct sunlight or at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but its growth will be slower, and it may not fruit as much.</p>
		<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 15cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
	<p><a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">Sow seeds</a> individually in a seedling tray filled with potting mix or seedling mix. Lightly mist the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 2 weeks.</p>

		<p>The seedlings will be vulnerable to high heat and heavy rain. It is best to kept them in a sheltered propagation area or a shaded space with around 4 hours of partial or direct sunlight.</p>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15-30cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 10 days.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Transplanting:</h4>
		<p>Seedlings will be ready for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/transplanting/">transplanting</a> into pots or true ground when they have developed 4 or more leaves, or roughly a week or two after germination. Leave 15-30cm between each plant to encourage more growth and better ventilation.
</p><section><a href="/
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
		<p>Bean plants generally don’t require much fertilising because they are able to fix their own nitrogen.</p>
		<p>Because the vines will grow on top of each other, it is a good practice to <a href=">prune regularly</a> and remove dead leaves and vines to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant.<p></p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
		<p>Plants can be harvested for flowers at any time.</p>
		<img title="Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/BluePeaFlower_JacChua%20(3).jpg">
		<p>Dry, brown seed pods are mature, and can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">harvested for seeds</a> to plant.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
		<p>This vine can be grown via <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seeds</a>. Seeds can be taken from mature fruit for immediate planting.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>If your vine has few to no flowers, you can fertilise the plant with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers high in phosphorus and potassium</a>.</p>
		<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">Spider Mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss.</p>
