	<p>Water Chestnuts are an aquatic crop that produce starchy roots often referred to as tubers, which are eaten raw, steamed, or processed into flour. The tuber flesh has the interesting property of maintaining its crispness even after cooking or canning, making this an important ingredient for providing crisp textures in food. This plant is also native to Singapore and is naturally found growing along coastal and inland marshy areas.</p>
	<p>A small perennial crop, Water chestnuts are grown in ponds as part of edible gardens and permaculture gardens.</p>
