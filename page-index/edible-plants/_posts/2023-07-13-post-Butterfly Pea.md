	<p>Butterfly Peas are a hardy edible flower that is used to colour drinks, desserts, and rice dishes.</p>
	<p>An <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#a">annual</a> plant, Butterfly Peas are often grown in rotation with other fruiting climbers.</p>
  <p>This plant is part of the 	Fabaceae or Bean family, which includes other popular edible fruits like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/winged-bean/">Winged Bean</a>, <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/peanut/">Peanut</a>, and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/sword-bean/">Sword Bean</a>.  All members of the bean family can be used for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/companion-planting/">companion planting</a> as they can fix nitrogen into the soil.</p>

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
		<img src="/images/Plants/BluePeaFlower_JacChua.jpg">
		<p>This plant thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-8 hours of direct sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 20cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>.</p>
		<p>This vine is vulnerable to heat stress during the dry season. Water it regularly and <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">mulch</a> the base to prevent water loss.</p>
	<p>As a fast-growing vine, this plant needs to be trained up a light <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/trellises/">trellis</a>. The vine readily produces flowers and can be used to beautify fences and arch trellises.</p>
		<p>As with all members of the bean family, this plant is pollinated by bees. Growing more <a href="/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants/">bee-attracting plants</a> within the garden will encourage pollination.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 10 days.</p>

		<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches/">cloche</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a>.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
		<p>Bean plants generally don’t require much fertilising because they are able to fix their own nitrogen.</p>
		<p>Because the vines will grow on top of each other, it is a good practice to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune regularly</a> and remove dead leaves and vines to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
		<p>Plants can be harvested for flowers at any time.</p>
		<img title="Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/BluePeaFlower_JacChua%20(3).jpg">
		<p>Dry, brown seed pods are mature, and can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">harvested for seeds</a> to plant.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
		<p>This vine can be grown via <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seeds</a>. Seeds can be taken from mature fruit for immediate planting.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>If your vine has few to no flowers, you can fertilise the plant with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers high in phosphorus and potassium</a>.</p>
		<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss.</p>
