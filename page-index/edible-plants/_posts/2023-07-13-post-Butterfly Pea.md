<p>Butterfly Peas are a hardy edible flower that is used to colour drinks, desserts, and rice dishes. </p>
	<p>An annual plant, Butterfly Peas are often grown in rotation with other fruiting climbers. </p>
  <p>This plant is part of the 	Fabaceae or Bean family, which includes other popular edible fruits like Winged Bean, Peanut, and Sword Bean.  All members of the bean family can be used for companion planting as they can fix nitrogen into the soil. </p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
		<img style="height:390px; width:520px" src="/images/Horti%20techniques/ContainerPlanting_JacChua%20(3).jpg">
<p>This plant thrives in 4-8 hours of direct sunlight. Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 20cm deep, or in true ground.  </p>
<p>This vine is vulnerable to heat stress during the dry season. Water it regularly and mulch the base to prevent water loss. </p>
<p>
As a fast-growing vine, this plant needs to be trained up a light trellis. The vine readily produces flowers and can be used to beautify fences and arch trellises.</p>

<p>As with all members of the bean family, this plant is pollinated by bees. Growing more bee-attracting plants within the garden will encourage pollination. </p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
<p>Seeds can be scattered directly into a pot or into true ground, and then covered with a layer of soil or compost. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within a week.</p>

	<br>

<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY cloche or netting.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
<p>Bayam is a rapid grower and will produce more leaves if fed with high nitrogen fertilisers. Plants can be fertilised regularly two weeks after germination for a fuller crop. </p>
<p>This plant can be grown incredibly close together with many plants in a small space. If plants are thinned out and given enough ventilation, they will grow thicker stems and will grow taller and bushier. </p>
<p>Bayam plants will die after producing seeds. Prolong your harvest by pruning off flowers when they appear.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Plants can be harvested for leaves at any time, with younger leaves being the most tender. However, the leaves will become tough as they get older. Most gardeners will harvest their crop around 3 weeks after sowing.</p>
<p>The whole plant can be harvested once by cutting the stalk at the base or multiple times by harvesting the young, tender stems from the top as per the cut-and-come-again method.</p>

<br><br>
<p>Bayam will start to flower after a few months or so. The flowers can be self-pollinated and will form brown seed capsules. Dry, brown seed pods are mature, and can be harvested for seeds to plant.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Bayam is primarily grown from seeds. </p>
	<p>Bayam seeds can be readily harvested from old plants that have flowered. Rub old and dry flower spikes between your fingers to collect the seeds for planting. </p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p>Caterpillars, usually from the Diamondback moth and Tussock moth, can rapidly eat all the leaves of your plant. If your plant has lots of large holes and small brown or black poo pellets scattered around damaged leaves, you likely have a caterpillar infestation. Manually remove the caterpillars by hand and protect your plants with netting.</p>
<p>Leaf miners are fly larvae that eat the leaves from the inside, leaving white lines or patches in their wake. Manually remove damaged leaves and use fine mesh netting to stop the adult flies from laying eggs on the plant again.</p>
<p>Etiolation is characterised by plants growing long and skinny, with weak stems and small leaves. The plants may also sometimes look yellowish. Plants etiolate when they do not get enough sunlight, which results in slow growth and untidy forms. To prevent this, grow plants in environments with enough light for them and make sure that each plant has enough space to prevent overcrowding.</p>
