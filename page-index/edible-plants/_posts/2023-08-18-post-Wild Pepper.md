	<p>Wild pepper is a common herb grown both for consumption in edible gardens but also as an ornamental plant as part of landscaping in shady urban areas. Wild pepper leaves have a peppery taste, and it is typically cooked raw with rice or meat. This plant is also native to Singapore and is naturally found growing in the understory of forests.</p>
	<p>This plant is a <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p/">perennial crop</a> that is easy to propagate, making it a popular choice for herb borders. It can also be used as an living mulch to suppress weeds and keep the soil cool as part of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/companion-planting/">companion planting</a>.</p>

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
	<p>This plant thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-6 hours of indirect sunlight</a>, but can also grow in 2-4 hours of direct sunlight.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 10cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within two weeks.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
<p>Wild pepper is a rapid grower and generally does not need fertiliser, but it can be fed with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">high nitrogen fertilisers</a> once every 6 months to encourage leaf growth. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regular pruning</a> will encourage additional growth and improve air circulation.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested for older leaves</a> at any time. They are typically harvested continuously via the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again/">cut-and-come-again</a>  method.</p>
	<p>Seeds can be harvested when fruit pods are dark green and dry.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Wild Pepper can be grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seeds</a>, but they are usually propagated via stem <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">cuttings rooted in water or soil</a>.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss.</p>
	<p>This plant may get leggy as it grows older. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Hard prune</a> it to encourage bushier growth.</p>
