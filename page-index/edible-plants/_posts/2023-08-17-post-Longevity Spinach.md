	<p>Longevity spinach is a hardy, succulent vegetable that grows well in semi-shade. Its leaves can be eaten raw, blanched, steamed, and made into soup.</p>
	<p>This plant is a small perennial crop that is easy to propagate, making it a popular choice as a <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#g">groundcover</a>, for perimeter planting, and low maintenance beds. It is also a staple crop in edible gardens and permaculture gardens.</p>
		<p>Due to its shallow root system, these plants are a popular choice for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">container gardening</a>.</p>
	<p>A native plant, it can be found along forest streams and sandy slopes.</p>

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
	<p>This plant grows best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-8 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. Plants may suffer from sunburn in more than 4 hours of direct sunlight.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 10cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
		<p>Longevity Spinach grows rapidly when young and freshly planted from cuttings. Regular harvesting will encourage the plant to grow more leaves and stems.</p>
	<p>This plant generally does not require fertilising, but it <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">can be fed with a high nitrogen fertiliser</a> around once a month or after harvest to encourage growth.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for young leaves at any time. They are typically harvested continuously via the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again/">cut-and-come-again</a> method.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
		<p>Longevity Spinach is typically propagated via <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">stem cuttings</a> in soil. Cuttings rooted in water are likely to rot.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>Smaller plants may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your plants with a DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches/">cloche</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a>.</p>
				<p>These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">sunburn</a> in more than 4 hours of direct sunlight. Use <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">shade netting</a> to protect your plants or replant in a shadier spot.</p>
				<p>This plant is especially vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a> caused by <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogging</a>. It is best to grow the plant in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy or sandy soil</a> with plenty of  <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">soil amendments</a> to prevent this.</p>
