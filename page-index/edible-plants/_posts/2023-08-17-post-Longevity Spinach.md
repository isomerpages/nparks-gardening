	<p>Longevity spinach is a hardy, succulent vegetable that grows well in semi-shade. Its leaves can be eaten raw, blanched, steamed, and made into soup.</p>
	<p>This plant is a small perennial crop that is easy to propagate, making it a popular choice as a <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#g/">groundcover</a>, for perimeter planting, and low maintenance beds. It is also a staple crop in edible gardens and permaculture gardens.</p>
		<p>Due to its shallow root system, these plants are a popular choice for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">container gardening</a>.</p>
	<p>A native plant, it can be found along forest streams and sandy slopes.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>This plant grows best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-8 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. Plants may suffer from sunburn in more than 4 hours of direct sunlight. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">moist, well-drained soil</a> at least 10cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening and corridor gardening. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>
