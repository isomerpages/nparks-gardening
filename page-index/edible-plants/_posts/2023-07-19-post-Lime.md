<p>Lime trees are a staple fruit tree in many tropical kitchen gardens, with the fruit juice used as flavouring for a wide range of dishes, drinks and desserts.</p>
<p>As a perennial tree, it is a common sight in edible gardens, permaculture gardens, and low maintenance beds.</p>
<p>The plant is part of the citrus family, which also includes Limau Purut. All citrus plants are host plants for the lime butterfly, and can be part of the planting palette for biodiversity-attracting gardens.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>This tree does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight. They can be grown in 4-6 hours of direct sunlight or 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but the plants may be small and produce less fruits.</p>
<p>Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 30cm deep, or in true ground. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe. </p>
<p>This tree can grow up to 6m high, and usually has a broad crown. Many gardeners maintain this plant as a large bush, and regularly prune it down to around 1 or 1.5m for easy harvesting.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground. Because the plant eventually grows into a tree, it is easier to grow a few seedlings in separate pots before selecting the healthiest one to be grown in true ground.</p>

<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY cloche or netting.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies. </p>
<p>Whiteflies can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray.</p>
