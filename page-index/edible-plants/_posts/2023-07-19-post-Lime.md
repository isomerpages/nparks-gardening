<p>Lime trees are a staple fruit tree in many tropical kitchen gardens, with the fruit juice used as flavouring for a wide range of dishes, drinks and desserts.</p>
<p>As a perennial tree, it is a common sight in edible gardens, permaculture gardens, and low maintenance beds.</p>
<p>The plant is part of the citrus family, which also includes Limau Purut. All citrus plants are host plants for the lime butterfly, and can be part of the planting palette for biodiversity-attracting gardens.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>This tree does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight. They can be grown in 4-6 hours of direct sunlight or 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but the plants may be small and produce less fruits.</p>
<p>Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 30cm deep, or in true ground. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe. </p>
<p>This tree can grow up to 6m high, and usually has a broad crown. Many gardeners maintain this plant as a large bush, and regularly prune it down to around 1 or 1.5m for easy harvesting.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground. Because the plant eventually grows into a tree, it is easier to grow a few seedlings in separate pots before selecting the healthiest one to be grown in true ground.</p>
<br>

<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Curry trees are rapid growers and will need regular pruning to be maintained at manageable height. Because they already grow rapidly, they generally do not require fertilising, but a use of a high nitrogen fertiliser after hard pruning will encourage the plant to bounce back quickly. </p>
<br>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Plants can be harvested for leaves at any time. Regular harvesting will encourage bushier growth and will keep the plant at a manageable height. </p>
<p>Mature, black fruits can be harvested for seeds. Sow seeds from ripe fruit immediately after harvesting as they tend to rot quickly.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Curry Leaf Plants can be grown from seed or propagated via woody stem cuttings. Woody stem cuttings should be dipped in rooting hormone before being potted up in rooting media. </p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>Like most strong-smelling herbs, this plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
<p>This plant is vulnerable to fungal diseases that form leaf spots during the wet season or when the plant is overgrown. Increase air circulation with regular pruning and remove affected leaves to reduce the spread.</p>
<p>Aphids, may infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
