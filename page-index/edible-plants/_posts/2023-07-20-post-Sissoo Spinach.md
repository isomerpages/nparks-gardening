<p>Sissoo spinach is a hardy, succulent vegetable that readily grows in semi-shade. Its leaves and stem can be blanched, steamed, and made into soup.</p>
<p>This plant is a small perennial crop that is easy to propagate, making it a popular choice as a groundcover, for perimeter planting, and low maintenance beds. It is also a staple crop in edible gardens and permaculture gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its shallow root system, these plants are a popular choice for container gardening and corridor gardening.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>This plant grows rapidly in at least 4 hours of indirect sunlight. Sissoo can also grow in 2-6 hours of direct sunlight, but will have smaller leaves and tend to wilt more regularly from heat stress. Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 5cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening and corridor gardening. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe.</p>

<p>The stems are liable to snap if they get too long. Regularly prune the plant to keep stems short. </p>
<p>This plant is very vulnerable to root rot from soil with a high clay content. Ensure that your soil drains well and has plenty of grit. </p>
