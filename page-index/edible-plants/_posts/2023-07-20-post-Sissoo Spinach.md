	<p>Sissoo spinach is a hardy, succulent vegetable that readily grows in semi-shade. Its leaves and stem can be blanched, steamed, and made into soup.</p>
	<p>This plant is a small <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop that is easy to propagate, making it a popular choice as a <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/companion-planting/">living mulch</a> in edible gardens.</p>
	<p>Due to its shallow root system and tolerance for shade, these plants are a popular choice for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">container gardening</a> and corridor gardening.</p>

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
	<p>This plant grows rapidly in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">at least 4 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. Sissoo Spinach can also grow in 2-6 hours of direct sunlight, but will have smaller leaves and tend to wilt more regularly from heat stress. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 10cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Sissoo Spinach grows rapidly when young and freshly planted from cuttings. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regular pruning</a> will encourage the plant to grow more leaves and stems.</p>
	<p>This plant generally does not require fertilising, but it can be fed with a <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">high nitrogen fertiliser</a> once every two months or after harvesting to encourage more growth.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for young leaves at any time. They are typically harvested continuously via the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again/">cut-and-come-again method</a>.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Sissoo Spinach is typically propagated <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">via stem cuttings</a> rooted in soil or water.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>Smaller plants may be vulnerable to being eaten by <a href="/page-index/pests/snails-and-slugs/">snails or slugs</a>. Protect your plants with a DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches/">cloche</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a>.</p>
