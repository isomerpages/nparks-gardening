	<p>Long beans are a hardy and productive crop suitable for new gardeners who want to grow a fruiting climber. Immature long beans can be eaten raw, stir-fried or steamed.</p>
	<p>An <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#a/">annual</a> crop, these plants are often grown as part of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/crop-rotation/">crop rotation</a> with other fruiting climbers. </p>
  <p>This plant is part of the 	Fabaceae or Bean family, which includes other popular edible fruits like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/winged-bean/">Winged Bean</a>, <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/peanut/">Peanut</a>, and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/butterfly-pea/">Butterfly Pea</a>.  All members of the bean family can be used for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/companion-planting/">companion planting</a> as they can fix nitrogen into the soil.</p>

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
	<p>This vine does best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of direct sunlight</a>. It can also grow in 4-6hours of direct sunlight or more than 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but the plant may be less lush and produce less fruits. </p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 30cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. </p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>

	<p><a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagation-by-seeds">Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground</a> around 15-30cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 2 weeks. </p>
<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by <a href="/page-index/pests/snails-and-slugs/">snails</a> or <a href="/page-index/pests/pests/#birds">birds</a>. Protect your young plants with a DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches">cloche</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting">netting</a>.</p> <p></p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Bean plants generally donâ€™t require much fertilising because they are able to fix their own nitrogen. However, they do benefit from being fed high potassium and phosphorus <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers</a> once a month after their first flower to encourage flowering and thus fruiting. </p>
<p>Because the vines will grow on top of each other, it is a good practice to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune</a> regularly and remove dead leaves and vines to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant.</p>
		<p>This vine is vulnerable to heat stress during the dry season. Water it regularly and <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">mulch</a> the base to prevent water loss.</p>
	<p>As a fast-growing vine, this plant can be grown on the ground or trained up a sturdy <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/trellises/">trellis</a>. The fruits are quite long and often exceed 30cm, so they do best on tall trellises. </p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<img title="Long bean fruits ready for harvest. Photo by Flora and Fauna web." src="/images/Plants/longbean_ffw_fruits.jpg">
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for fruits around 2 months after sowing. The best time to harvest the fruit is in the early morning, before 9am. </p>
	<p>Only green, immature beans can be eaten. Dry, brown pods are mature, and can be used for seeds.

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<img title="Long bean seedlings. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/longbean_seedlings_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>This vine can be grown <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seeds/">via seeds</a>. </p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p>Young plants have soft stems and can be completely eaten by <a href="/page-index/pests/snails-and-slugs/">slugs and snails</a>. Grow seedlings till they are at least 10cm tall before planting them in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>, or use DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches/">cloches</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a> to protect young plants. </p>
<p>If your plant has few to no flowers, you can fertilise the plant with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers high in phosphorus and potassium</a>. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>
<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
		<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/pests/#rodents">Squirrels and birds</a> may eat unripe or ripe fruit. Wrap your fruit in <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting">netting</a> when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off.</p>
