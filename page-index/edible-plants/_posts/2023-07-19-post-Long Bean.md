	<p>Long beans are a hardy and productive crop suitable for new gardeners who want to grow a fruiting climber. Immature long beans can be eaten raw, stir-fried or steamed.</p>
	<p>An <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#a/">annual</a> crop, these plants are often grown in rotation with other fruiting climbers. </p>
	<p>This plant is part of the 	Fabaceae or Bean family, which includes other popular edible fruits like Winged Bean, Peanut, and Sword Bean.  All members of the bean family can be used for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/companion-planting">companion planting</a> as they can fix nitrogen into the soil.

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>This vine does best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of direct sunlight</a>. It can also grow in 4-6hours of direct sunlight or more than 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but the plant may be less lush and produce less fruits. </p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 30cm deep, or in true ground. </p>
	<p>This vine is vulnerable to heat stress during the dry season. Water it regularly and <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">mulch</a> the base to prevent water loss.</p>
	<p>As a fast-growing vine, this plant can be grown on the ground or trained up a sturdy <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/trellises/">trellis</a>. The fruits are quite long and often exceed 30cm, so they do best on tall trellises. </p>
	<p>As with all members of the bean family, this plant is pollinated by bees. Growing more <a href="/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants">bee-attracting plants</a> within the garden will encourage pollination. </p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15-30cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 2 weeks. </p>

<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches/">cloche</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a>. </p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Bean plants generally donâ€™t require much fertilising because they are able to fix their own nitrogen. 
Because the vines will grow on top of each other, it is a good practice to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune</a> regularly and remove dead leaves and vines to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<img title="A long bean starting to dry out. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/longbean%20(2)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for fruits around 2 months after sowing. The best time to harvest the fruit is in the early morning, before 9am. </p>
	<p>Only green, immature beans can be eaten. Dry, brown pods are mature, and can be used for seeds.

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>This vine can be grown <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seeds/">via seeds</a>. </p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">mealy bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, lack of sunlight, and <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiencies/">nutrient deficiencies</a>. </p>
	<p>Whiteflies can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray. </p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">mulch at the base to prevent water loss.</a></p><a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">
