	<h3>Spearmint (<em>Mentha spicata</em>)</h3>

<section>
	<p><strong>Other common names:</strong> English Mint, 留兰香</p>

	<p>Spearmint is a common herb that grows well in semi-shade gardens and is a popular choice for small and upcycled containers due to its shallow roots. Spearmint is harvested for its leaves and is used to flavour teas, desserts, and salads.</p>
	<p>This plant can grow as a <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop when used as a groundcover in true ground as it readily produces runners with plantlets that repropagates itself. However, it behaves as an <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#a">annual</a> in pots and will need to be regularly repropagated from cuttings. </p>
	<p>Spearmints are part of the Lamiaceae or Mint family, which includes other popular herbs like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/indian-borage/">Indian Borage</a>, <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/thai-basil/">Thai Basil</a>, and Chin Chow.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>Spearmints are usually grown in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">about 4-8 hours of indirect sunlight, or 2-6 hours of direct sunlight</a> if watered frequently. Spearmints are vulnerable to heat stress, and need to be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering/">watered frequently</a> during the dry season or if they are grown in more than 4 hours of direct sunlight. </p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a>l at least 5cm deep, making them suitable for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">container gardening</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Spearmint grows rapidly when young and freshly propagated from cuttings. Regular harvesting and the use of high nitrogen fertilisers will encourage the plant to grow more leaves.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for leaves at any time. They are typically harvested continuously via the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again/">cut-and-come-again method</a>.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Spearmint is usually propagated <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings">via stem cuttings</a> rooted in water or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">division</a>. </p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>Like most strong-smelling herbs, this plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, or move it to a shadier part of the garden.</p>
