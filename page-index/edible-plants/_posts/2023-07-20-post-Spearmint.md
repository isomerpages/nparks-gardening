<section>
<p>Spearmint is a common herb that grows well in semi-shade gardens and is a popular choice for small and upcycled containers due to its shallow roots. Spearmint is harvested for its leaves and is used to flavour teas, desserts, and salads.</p>
<p>This plant can grow as a perennial crop when used as a groundcover in true ground as it readily produces runners with plantlets that repropagates itself. However, it behaves as an annual in pots and will need to be regularly repropagated from cuttings. </p>
<p>Spearmints are part of the Lamiaceae or Mint family, which includes other popular herbs like Indian Borage, Thai Basil, and Chin Chow.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
<p>Spearmints are usually grown in about 4-8 hours of indirect sunlight, or 2-6 hours of direct sunlight if watered frequently. Spearmints are vulnerable to heat stress, and need to be watered frequently during the dry season or if they are grown in more than 4 hours of direct sunlight. </p>
<p>Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 5cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Spearmint grows rapidly when young and freshly propagated from cuttings. Regular harvesting and the use of high nitrogen fertilisers will encourage the plant to grow more leaves.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Plants can be harvested for leaves at any time. They are typically harvested continuously via the cut-and-come-again method. </p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p>Like most strong-smelling herbs, this plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p><p>
</p><p>Wilting leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, or move it to a shadier part of the garden.</p>
