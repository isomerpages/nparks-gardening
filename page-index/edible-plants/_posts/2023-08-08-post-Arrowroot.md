	<h3>Arrowroot (<em>Maranta arundinacea</em>)</h3>
</header>
	
<section>
	<p><strong>Other common names:</strong> West Indian Arrowroot, 竹芋</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<p>Arrowroot is primarily grown for its rhizome, an underground horizontal stem that resembles a tuberous root. The rhizome can be eaten fried or steamed, or processed into flour.</p>
	<p>It is a medium perennial crop that readily grows in the tropics in both true ground and in pots. This is a common plant in edible gardens, permaculture gardens, and low maintenance beds.</p>       
	<br>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>Arrowroot grows well in 4-6 hours of direct sunlight or 6-8 hours of indirect sunlight. Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 15cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening and corridor gardening. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe.</p>
<p>This plant will not do well in hot, exposed places like on rooftop gardens, and will be prone to sunburn.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4>

	<p>Mulberry trees are rapid growers and generally do not require fertilising. Regular hard pruning will keep the plant at a manageable size and encourage fruiting.</p>
	<p>The tree will need to be around 4 years old before it starts producing fruit if grown from seed. Rooted cuttings can produce fruit after a month if taken from a mature tree.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Young leaves can be harvested at any time.</p>
	<p>Ripe fruits are pink, dark purple or white, depending on the variety. Ripe fruits should be harvested for immediate consumption.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>This tree can be grown via seed but are usually propagated via woody cuttings with rooting hormone.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
	<p>Whiteflies can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray.</p>
	<p>Squirrels, birds and fruit bats may eat unripe or ripe fruit. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off.</p>
