	<p>Arrowroot is primarily grown for its <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#r">rhizome</a>, an underground horizontal stem that resembles a tuberous root. The rhizome can be eaten fried or steamed, or processed into flour.</p>
	<p>It is a medium <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop that readily grows in the tropics in both true ground and in pots. This is a common plant in edible gardens, permaculture gardens, and low maintenance beds.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>Arrowroot grows well in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-6 hours of direct sunlight or 6-8 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 15cm deep, making them suitable for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">container gardening</a> and corridor gardening. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>
<p>This plant will not do well in hot, exposed places like on rooftop gardens, and will be prone to sunburn.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>This plant naturally grows in clusters as the plant grows more rhizomes. Thin plants out to give them around 5-10cm of space to encourage the production of more rhizomes. </p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>

	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for rhizomes at any time. They are typically harvested continuously via division.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>

	<p>Arrowroot is propagated <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">via division</a> of the rhizome.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering/">watered daily</a> or move it to a shadier part of the garden.</p>
	<p>This plant’s leaves may develop brown, dry patches if exposed to too much sunlight. Prevent sun burn by planting it in shade or cover it with <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">shade netting</a>.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">mealy bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Prune off</a> the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, lack of sunlight, and <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiencies/">nutrient deficiencies</a>.</p>
