	<p>Arrowroot is primarily grown for its <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#r">rhizome</a>, an underground horizontal stem that resembles a tuberous root. The rhizome can be eaten fried or steamed, or processed into flour.</p>
	<p>A medium <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop, it readily grows in the tropics in both <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a> and in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a>. This is an uncommon plant in edible gardens.</p>

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
	<p>Arrowroot grows well in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-6 hours of direct sunlight or 6-8 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. </p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 15cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>
<p>This plant will not do well in hot, exposed places like on rooftop gardens, and will be prone to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">sunburn</a>.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>This plant naturally grows in clusters as the plant grows more rhizomes. Thin plants out to give them around 5-10cm of space to encourage the production of more rhizomes. </p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>

	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for rhizomes at any time. They are typically harvested continuously via division.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>

	<p>Arrowroot is propagated <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">via division</a> of the rhizome.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>This plant’s leaves may develop <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">sunburn</a> if exposed to too much sunlight. Prevent this by planting it in shade or cover it with <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">shade netting</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">Spider Mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
		<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering/">watered daily</a> or move it to a shadier part of the garden.</p>
