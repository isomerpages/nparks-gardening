	<p>Bang Kwang is a large, climbing vine that is harvested for its starchy tuber. The tuber can be eaten raw, stir-fried, or steamed in a variety of dishes, and is most well-known as a component of Rojak and Popiah in Singapore.</p>
	<p>An annual crop, these plants are often grown in rotation with other fruiting climbers.</p>
	<p>This plant is part of the 	Fabaceae or Bean family, which includes other popular edible fruits like Winged Bean, Peanut, and Sword Bean.  All members of the bean family can be used for companion planting as they can fix nitrogen into the soil.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>This vine does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight. It can also grow in areas with at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but growth may be slower.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 30cm deep, or in true ground.</p>
	<p>This vine is vulnerable to heat stress during the dry season. Water it regularly and mulch the base to prevent water loss.</p>
	<p>As a fast-growing vine, this plant can be grown on the ground or trained up a sturdy trellis.</p>

	<p>As with all members of the bean family, this plant is pollinated by bees. Growing more bee-attracting plants within the garden will encourage pollination.</p>

	<h4>Sowing Seeds</h4>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15-30cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 10 days.</p>

	<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY cloche or netting.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Bean plants generally donâ€™t require much fertilising because they are able to fix their own nitrogen.</p>
	<p>Because the vines will grow on top of each other, it is a good practice to prune regularly and remove dead leaves and vines to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Tubers can be harvested around 5 months after sowing. Take note that once tubers are harvested, the rest of the plant will die.</p>
	<p>Be aware that the skin of the tuber, leaves, fruits, flowers and stem are highly toxic. Ensure that the tuber has been scraped clean of skin before consumption.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>This vine can be grown via seeds. Seeds can be taken from mature fruit for immediate planting.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
	<p>Whiteflies can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray.</p> 
	<p>Wilting leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss.</p>
