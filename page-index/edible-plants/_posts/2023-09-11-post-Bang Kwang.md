	<p>Bang Kwang is a large, climbing vine that is harvested for its starchy tuber. The tuber can be eaten raw, stir-fried, or steamed in a variety of dishes, and is most well-known as a component of Rojak and Popiah in Singapore.</p>
	<p>An <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#a">annual</a> crop, these plants are often grown in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/crop-rotation/">rotation</a> with other fruiting climbers.</p>
<p>This plant is part of the 	Fabaceae or Bean family, which includes other popular edible fruits like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/winged-bean/">Winged Bean</a>, <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/peanut/">Peanut</a>, and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/sword-bean/">Sword Bean</a>.  All members of the bean family can be used for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/companion-planting/">companion planting</a> as they can fix nitrogen into the soil.</p>

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
	<img title="Bangkwang flowers. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/bangkwang%20(1)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>This vine does best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight</a>. It can also grow in areas with at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but growth may be slower.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 30cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>.</p>
	<p>This vine is vulnerable to heat stress during the dry season. Water it regularly and <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">mulch</a> the base to prevent water loss.</p>

	<p><a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagation-by-seeds">Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground</a> around 15-30cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 10 days.</p>
<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by <a href="/page-index/pests/snails-and-slugs/">snails</a> or <a href="/page-index/pests/pests/#birds">birds</a>.

  <h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Bean plants generally donâ€™t require much fertilising because they are able to fix their own nitrogen. However, they do benefit from being fed high potassium and phosphorus <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers</a> once a month after their first flower to encourage additional root and tuber growth. </p>
		<p>Because the vines will grow on top of each other, it is a good practice to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune regularly</a> and remove dead leaves and vines to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant.</p>
		<p>As a fast-growing vine, this plant needs to be trained up a light <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/trellises/">trellis</a>. The vine readily produces flowers and can be used to beautify fences and arch trellises.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<img title="Bangkwang tubers on sale in a wetmarket. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/bangkwang_root_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>Tubers can be harvested around 5 months after sowing. Take note that once tubers are harvested, the rest of the plant will die.</p>
	<p><b>Be aware that the skin of the tuber, leaves, fruits, flowers and stem are highly toxic. Ensure that the tuber has been scraped clean of skin before consumption.</b></p>

			<p>Dry, brown seed pods are mature, and can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">harvested for seeds</a> to plant.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
		<p>This vine can be grown via <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seeds</a>. Seeds can be taken from mature fruit for immediate planting.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p>Young plants have soft stems and can be completely eaten by <a href="/page-index/pests/snails-and-slugs/">slugs and snails</a>. Grow seedlings till they are at least 10cm tall before planting them in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>, or use DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches/">cloches</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a> to protect young plants. </p>
<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
		<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss.</p>
