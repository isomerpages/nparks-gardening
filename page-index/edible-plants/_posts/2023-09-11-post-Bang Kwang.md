	<h3>Bang Kwang (<em>Pachyrhizus erosus</em>)</h3>

<section>
	<p><strong>Other common names:</strong> Bangkuang, Jicama, Mexican Turnip, Sengkuang, Yam Bean</p>

	<p>Bang Kwang is a large, climbing vine that is harvested for its starchy tuber. The tuber can be eaten raw, stir-fried, or steamed in a variety of dishes, and is most well-known as a component of Rojak and Popiah in Singapore.</p>
	<p>An annual crop, these plants are often grown in rotation with other fruiting climbers.</p>
	<p>This plant is part of the 	Fabaceae or Bean family, which includes other popular edible fruits like Winged Bean, Peanut, and Sword Bean.  All members of the bean family can be used for companion planting as they can fix nitrogen into the soil.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>This vine does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight. It can also grow in areas with at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but growth may be slower.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 30cm deep, or in true ground.</p>
	<p>This vine is vulnerable to heat stress during the dry season. Water it regularly and mulch the base to prevent water loss.</p>
	<p>As a fast-growing vine, this plant can be grown on the ground or trained up a sturdy trellis.</p>

	<p>As with all members of the bean family, this plant is pollinated by bees. Growing more bee-attracting plants within the garden will encourage pollination.</p>

	<h4>Sowing Seeds</h4>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground. Because the plant eventually grows into a tree, it is easier to grow a few seedlings in separate pots before selecting the healthiest one to be grown in true ground.</p>
	<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY cloche or netting.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Guava trees are steady growers but do benefit from being fed high potassium and phosphorus fertilisers to encourage flowering and thus fruiting. Regular pruning to promote airflow will keep the plant healthy and neat.</p>
	<p>The tree will need to be around 5 years old before it starts producing fruit if grown from seed.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Fruits are considered ripe when they are slightly soft to the touch but are not mushy. Ripe fruits will also have a strong, sweet fragrance. Fruits can be harvested unripe then left to ripen off the tree or harvested ripe for immediate consumption.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>This tree is grown via seed, or via woody cuttings with rooting hormone.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>If your plant has little to no flowers, you try fertilising the plant with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>
	<p>Many plants require pollinators to help them fruit. Bees, butterflies, birds and even beetles transport pollen from one flower to another, pollinating your crops and increasing their fruit yield. Attract some pollinators to your garden by growing pollinator-attracting crops, or become a pollinator yourself by hand-pollinating your plants.</p>
	<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
	<p>Whiteflies can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray. 
Fruit flies can lay eggs in the fruit, resulting in larvae damaging the fruit and creating spots on the skin. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off.</p>
	<p>Squirrels, birds and fruit bats may eat unripe or ripe fruit. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off.</p>
