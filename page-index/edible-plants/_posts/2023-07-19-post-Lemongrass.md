<p>Lemongrass is a large aromatic herb that grows in a grass-like clump. Oil is extracted from the stem to flavour drinks, desserts, and soups. The oils are also used as a scent for perfumes, candles, and aromatherapy products. </p>
	<p>Lemongrass is a <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop that is drought-tolerant readily grows in most gardens with full sunlight. Due to its large size and rapid growth, it is recommended to plant it in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. </p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
		<img title="Lemongrass growing in sandy soil. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/Lemongrass_JacChua.jpg">
<p>Lemongrass flourishes in 6-8 hours of direct sunlight. Plants do best in<a href="https://staging.dmhtu0pi4p9u7.amplifyapp.com/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">sandy soil</a> at least 15cm deep, making them suitable for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">container gardening</a>, but the diameter of the pot will greatly limit the size of the plant. Take note that Lemongrass can grow up to 1.2m tall, and that larger pots of at least 20cm width will be needed for the plant to grow offshoots. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">inorganic soil amendments</a> to let the roots breathe. </p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Lemongrass plants grow rapidly, especially with regular harvesting. They are particularly fast growers during the dry season. If planted in true ground near other plants, Lemongrass can smother its neighbours if it is not cut back regularly. </p>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Plants can be harvested for stems and leaves at any time. Stems can be harvested by being cut at the base of the plant, or by twisting and pulling.</p>
<p>Leaves can be cut at any time for use as mulch. </p>
<p>Take note that the leaves have sharp edges and may cause skin irritation and cuts. Use arm sleeves and gloved when maintaining Lemongrass plants for safety.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p>Like most strong-smelling herbs, this plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites can the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies. </p>
