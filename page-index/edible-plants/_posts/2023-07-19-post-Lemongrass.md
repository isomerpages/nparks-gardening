<p>Lemongrass is a large aromatic herb that grows in a grass-like clump. Oil is extracted from the stem to flavour drinks, desserts, and soups. The oils are also used as a scent for perfumes, candles, and aromatherapy products. </p>
<p>Lemongrass is a perennial crop that readily grows in most gardens with full sunlight. Due to its large size, and rapid growth, it is recommended to plant it in true ground. </p>
<p>Because lemongrass grows so rapidly, its leaves can be harvested to make mulch, or the plant can be used as a groundcover for low maintenance beds. </p>
<p>As a strong-smelling herb, it can also be used for companion planting to discourage pests.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
<p>Lemongrass flourishes in 6-8 hours of direct sunlight. Plants do best in sandy, well-drained soil at least 15cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening, but the diameter of the pot will greatly limit the size of the plant. Take note that Lemongrass can grow up to 1.2m tall, and that larger pots of at least 20cm width will be needed for the plant to grow offshoots. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter and grit to let the roots breathe. </p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Lemongrass plants grow rapidly, especially with regular harvesting. They are particularly fast growers during the dry season. If planted in true ground near other plants, Lemongrass can smother its neighbours if it is not cut back regularly. </p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Plants can be harvested for leaves at any time. They are typically harvested continuously via the cut-and-come-again method. Regular harvesting via hard pruning will encourage bushiness and keep the plant productive.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p>Like most strong-smelling herbs, this plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
<p>Wilting leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily or move it to a shadier part of the garden.</p>
<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies. </p>
