	<p>Thai basil is a staple herb in many Southeast Asian gardens, and thrives in tropical climates. Thai basil leaves and flowers are harvested for salads, sauces, soups and stir-fries for many Thai and Vietnamese dishes.</p>
	<p>Thai Basil plants are typically treated as <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#a">annual</a> crops due to their rapid flowering, but they can also be kept as <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#a">perennials</a> if their flowers are pruned before they can set seed.</p>
	<p>Thai Basils are part of the Lamiaceae or Mint family, which includes other popular herbs like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/indian-borage/">Indian Borage</a>, and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/spearmint/">Spearmint</a>.</p>

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>

	<p>Thai Basil thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-6 hours of direct sunlight</a>, but plants can also tolerate about 6-8 hours of indirect sunlight. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 15cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe. Keep your plants cool with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">mulch</a> and plenty of water to encourage growth.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>

	<p><a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">Sow seeds individually</a> in a seedling tray filled with potting mix or seedling mix. Lightly mist the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within two weeks.</p>
	<p>The seedlings will be vulnerable to high heat and heavy rain and are best kept in a sheltered propagation area or a shaded space with around 4 hours of partial or direct sunlight. </p>
	<p>Seeds can also be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within a week.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Transplanting:</h4>
	<p>Seedlings will be ready for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/transplanting/">transplanting</a> into pots or true ground when they are roughly 10cm tall. Leave 15cm between each plant to encourage more growth and better ventilation.</p>
	<br>
</section>
	
<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Thai Basil plants grow rapidly, especially with regular harvesting. The use of high nitrogen fertilisers will encourage the plant to grow more leaves. Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilised</a> once a month after transplanting, or after <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">hard pruning</a>.</p>
	<p>Thai basil plants will die after setting seed. Prolong your harvest by pinching off flowers when they appear.

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be harvested for leaves at any time. They are typically harvested continuously via the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again/">cut-and-come-again method</a>. Regular harvesting via pruning will encourage bushiness and keep the plant productive.</p>

	<p><a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">Seeds</a> can be harvested from flowers that have developed into dry, brown seed capsules.</p>

	<p>Thai Basil can be grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seed</a> or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">propagated via stem cuttings</a> rooted in water or soil.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>Like most strong-smelling herbs, this plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
		<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss.</p>
