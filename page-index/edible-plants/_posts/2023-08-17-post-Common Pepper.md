	<p>Common Pepper plants produce small hard fruits that can be processed into various kinds of pepper. Traditional black pepper is made from the dried immature fruit, white pepper is made from the seeds of mature fruit, while green pepper is made from fresh, immature fruit.</p>
	<p>As a <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> vine, it is a common sight in edible gardens, permaculture gardens, and low maintenance beds.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>This vine does best in gardens with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light">a minimum of 6 hours of bright indirect sunlight or dappled shade</a>. More than 6 hours of direct sunlight might burn the plant.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil">moist, well-drained soil</a> at least 30cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground">true ground</a>. The plant can be grown in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers">smaller pots</a> about 20cm deep, but growth will be slower due to the lack of water retention in less soil and a smaller root ball.</p>
	<p>As a fast-growing vine, this plant needs a tall, sturdy <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/trellises">trellis</a> to scramble on. It can be trained up walls, or large trees.</p>
	<p>This plant can be grown year-round.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15-30cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 10 days.</p>

	<p>The seedlings are vulnerable to heat stress and wilting. Water seedlings daily or once every other day during the dry season.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Common Peppers grow readily without fertilisers and will produce fruits all year long. However, they can be fed with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising">fertilisers</a> high in Phosphorus and Potassium to encourage additional flower and thus fruit growth.</p>
	<p>Because the vines will grow on top of each other, it is a good practice to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning">prune regularly</a> and remove dead leaves and vines to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant. Regular pruning will also encourage the plant to grow more shoots and produce more flowers and thus fruit.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants will take 3-4 years to flower and grow fruit. However, it will readily produce fruits all year long for many years once it is mature.</p>
	<p>Immature fruits can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene">harvested</a> for use as green pepper once the green fruits fill out the spike. Mature fruits are red and can be dried to produce black pepper. Alternatively, the mature fruits can be fermented to remove the flesh from the seeds to produce white pepper.</p>
	<p>Seeds to be used for white pepper can also be used for immediate planting to grow new plants.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>This vine can be grown <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagation-by-seeds">via seeds</a> or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagation-by-cuttings">cuttings</a> rooted in soil or water.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>If your vine has little to no flowers, you try <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising">fertilising</a> the plant with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs">mealy bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning">Prune off</a> the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot">root rot</a>, lack of sunlight, and <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiencies">nutrient deficiencies</a>.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies">Whiteflies</a> can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray.</p>
