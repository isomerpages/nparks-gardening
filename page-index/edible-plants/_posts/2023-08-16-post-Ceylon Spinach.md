	<p>Ceylon spinach is a striking vine that is harvested for its leaves, stems, and fruits.  Young leaves and stems are harvested for salads and stews, with the sticky sap used as a thickening agent for soups. Cooked leaves taste like spinach, with a slippery texture similar to <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/ladys-finger/">Lady’s Finger</a>.</p>
	<p>The plant produces purple fruits which are used to colour jellies, pastries, and sweets. The natural dye produced from the berries were used in China to make inks for seals by court officials, which is why the plant is also known as Emperor Sprouts (帝皇苗).</p>
	<p>As a large <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop that grows as a vine, it is a common sight in edible gardens, permaculture gardens, and low maintenance beds.</p>

  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4> 
	<p>This vine needs about <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-6 hours of direct sunlight or 6-8 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. This plant will grow faster in direct sunlight but will tolerate shadier conditions. </p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 15cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>

	<p><a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground</a> around 10cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within a week.</p> 
<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by <a href="/page-index/pests/snails-and-slugs/">snails</a> or <a href="/page-index/pests/pests/#birds">birds</a>. Protect your young plants with a DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches">cloche</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting">netting</a>.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Ceylon spinach grows rapidly when fed with high nitrogen fertilisers. Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilised regularly</a> two weeks after germination for a fuller crop.</p>
	<p>Because the vines will grow on top of each other, it is a good practice to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune regularly</a> to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant.</p>
		<p>As a fast-growing vine, this plant needs a sturdy <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/trellises/">trellis</a> to scramble on, or it can be left to sprawl on the ground. </p> 
	<p>This vine grows large very rapidly and can climb up to 10m if a tall enough surface is available. Prune it back to manageable heights (around 1.5m) to make harvesting and maintenance easier.</p>

<section> 
  <h4>Harvesting:</h4> 
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for leaves and stems, with younger leaves being the most tender. Most gardeners will begin harvesting from their Ceylon Spinach plant around 2 months after sowing.</p>
	<p>Ceylon Spinach is typically harvested multiple times by harvesting the younger leaves and stems as per the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again/">cut-and-come-again</a> method.</p>

  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
	<img title="Ceylon Spinach cutting planted in true ground. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/img_9692_jacquelinechua.jpg">
		<p>This vine can be grown <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">via seeds</a> or by <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">stem cuttings</a> rooted in water or soil.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
			<p>Young plants have soft stems and can be completely eaten by <a href="/page-index/pests/snails-and-slugs/">slugs and snails</a>. Grow seedlings till they are at least 10cm tall before planting them in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>, or use DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches/">cloches</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a> to protect young plants. </p>
	<p>This plant is vulnerable to fungal diseases that form leaf spots during the wet season or when the plant is overgrown. Increase air circulation with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">regular pruning</a> and remove affected leaves to reduce the spread.</p>
	<p>This plant is susceptible to root-knot nematodes which cause the plant to have galls on its roots which result in leaf <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">wilting</a> and root decay. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/crop-rotation/">Rotate your crops</a> and change the soil to remedy the infestation.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/etiolation/">Etiolation</a> is characterised by plants growing long and skinny, with weak stems and small leaves. The plants may also sometimes look yellowish. Plants etiolate when they do not get enough sunlight, which results in slow growth and untidy forms. To prevent this, grow plants in environments with enough light for them and make sure that each plant has enough space to prevent overcrowding.</p>
<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">Spider Mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
		<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss.</p>
