	<p>Ceylon spinach is a striking vine that is harvested for its leaves, stems, and fruits.  Young leaves and stems are harvested for salads and stews, with the sticky sap used as a thickening agent for soups. Cooked leaves taste like spinach, with a slippery texture similar to <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/ladys-finger/">Lady’s Finger</a>.</p>
	<p>The plant produces purple fruits which are used to colour jellies, pastries, and sweets. The natural dye produced from the berries were used in China to make inks for seals by court officials, which is why the plant is also known as Emperor Sprouts (帝皇苗).</p>
	<p>As a large <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop that grows as a vine, it is a common sight in edible gardens, permaculture gardens, and low maintenance beds.</p>

  <h4>Environmental needs:</h4> 
	<p>This vine needs about <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-6 hours of direct sunlight or 6-8 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. This plant will grow faster in direct sunlight but will tolerate shadier conditions. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">moist, well-drained soil</a> at least 30cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. The plant can be grown in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">smaller pots</a> about 15cm deep, but growth will be less vigorous due to the shallow soil.</p>
	<p>As a fast-growing vine, this plant needs a sturdy <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/trellises/">trellis</a> to scramble on, or it can be left to sprawl on the ground. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regular pruning</a> will encourage additional growth and improve air circulation.</p>

<section> 
  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4> 
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 10cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within a week.</p>

	<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches/">cloche</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a>.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Ceylon spinach grows rapidly when fed with high nitrogen fertilisers. Plants can be fertilised regularly two weeks after germination for a fuller crop.</p>
	<p>Because the vines will grow on top of each other, it is a good practice to prune regularly to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant.</p>
	<p>This vine grows large very rapidly and can climb up to 10m if a tall enough surface is available. Prune it back to manageable heights (around 1.5m) to make harvesting and maintenance easier.</p>

<section> 
  <h4>Harvesting:</h4> 
	<p>Plants can be harvested for leaves and stems, with younger leaves being the most tender. Most gardeners will begin harvesting from their Ceylon Spinach plant around 2 months after sowing.</p>
	<p>Ceylon Spinach is typically harvested multiple times by harvesting the younger leaves and stems as per the <a href="https://staging.dmhtu0pi4p9u7.amplifyapp.com/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again/">cut-and-come-again</a> method.</p>

  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
		<p>This vine can be grown via seeds or by stem cuttings rooted in water or soil.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>This plant is vulnerable to fungal diseases that form leaf spots during the wet season or when the plant is overgrown. Increase air circulation with regular pruning and remove affected leaves to reduce the spread.</p>
	<p>This plant is susceptible to root-knot nematodes which cause the plant to have galls on its roots which result in leaf wilting and root decay. Rotate your crops and change the soil to remedy the infestation.</p>
	<p>Etiolation is characterised by plants growing long and skinny, with weak stems and small leaves. The plants may also sometimes look yellowish. Plants etiolate when they do not get enough sunlight, which results in slow growth and untidy forms. To prevent this, grow plants in environments with enough light for them and make sure that each plant has enough space to prevent overcrowding.</p>
	<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
	<p>Whiteflies can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray.</p>
