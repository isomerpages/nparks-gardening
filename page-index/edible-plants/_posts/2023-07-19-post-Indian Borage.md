	<p>Indian borage is a hardy, succulent herb that grows well in semi-shade and full sun conditions. Its leaves smell strongly of oregano and is typically made into tea as a remedy for sore throats. </p>
	<p>This plant is a <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop with shallow roots that is easy to propagate, making it a popular choice for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers">container gardening</a> and herb borders. </p>

	<p>As with most herbs, Indian Borage are usually grown in about <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-8 hours of indirect sunlight, or 2-6 hours of direct sunlight</a>. </p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 10cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>.</p>
	<p> These plants  are very vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well and have plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">inorganic soil amendments. </a></p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Indian borage grows rapidly when young and freshly planted from cuttings. Regular <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> will encourage the plant to grow more leaves and stems.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>Like most strong-smelling herbs, this plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>The stems are liable to snap if they get too long. Regularly <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune</a> the plant to keep stems short. </p>
