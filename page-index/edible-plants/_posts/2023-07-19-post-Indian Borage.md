<p>Indian borage is a hardy, succulent herb that grows well in semi-shade and full sun conditions. Its leaves smell strongly of oregano and is typically made into tea as a remedy for sore throats. </p>
<p>This plant is a perennial crop with shallow roots that is easy to propagate, making it a popular choice for container gardening and corridor gardening. </p>
<p>Indian Borage is part of the Lamiaceae or Mint family, which includes other popular herbs like Spearmint, Thai Basil, and Chin Chow.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>

<img title="Photo by Jacqueline Chua" src="/images/Plants/IndianBorage_JacChua%20(2).jpg">
	<p>As with most herbs, Indian Borage are usually grown in about 4-8 hours of indirect sunlight, or 2-6 hours of direct sunlight Plants do best in sandy, well-drained soil at least 10cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening. These plants are also highly drought tolerant, making them very low maintenance. However, they are very vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well and have plenty of grit. </p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 30cm-1m apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout around two weeks.</p>
<br>

<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Curry trees are rapid growers and will need regular pruning to be maintained at manageable height. Because they already grow rapidly, they generally do not require fertilising, but a use of a high nitrogen fertiliser after hard pruning will encourage the plant to bounce back quickly. </p>
<br>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Plants can be harvested for leaves at any time. Regular harvesting will encourage bushier growth and will keep the plant at a manageable height. </p>
<p>Mature, black fruits can be harvested for seeds. Sow seeds from ripe fruit immediately after harvesting as they tend to rot quickly.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Curry Leaf Plants can be grown from seed or propagated via woody stem cuttings. Woody stem cuttings should be dipped in rooting hormone before being potted up in rooting media. </p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>Like most strong-smelling herbs, this plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
<p>This plant is vulnerable to fungal diseases that form leaf spots during the wet season or when the plant is overgrown. Increase air circulation with regular pruning and remove affected leaves to reduce the spread.</p>
<p>Aphids, may infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
