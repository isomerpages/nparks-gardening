	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<img title="Photo by Jacqueline Chua" src="/images/Plants/IndianBorage_JacChua%20(2).jpg">
	<p>As with most herbs, Indian Borage are usually grown in about <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauing-light/">4-8 hours of indirect sunlight, or 2-6 hours of direct sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">sandy soil</a> at least 10cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening. These plants are also highly drought tolerant, making them very low maintenance. However, they are very vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well and have plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">inorganic soil amendments. </a></p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Indian borage grows rapidly when young and freshly planted from cuttings. Regular <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> will encourage the plant to grow more leaves and stems.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>Like most strong-smelling herbs, this plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>The stems are liable to snap if they get too long. Regularly <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune</a> the plant to keep stems short. </p>
