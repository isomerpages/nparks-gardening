	<p>One of the most recognisable leafy vegetables, lettuces come in a variety of shapes and colours, with flat-leaved, curly, green, and red cultivars serving as exciting options for the edible gardener. Loose-leaf lettuces do better in the tropics as the leaves have plenty of airflow, and the clear leaf seperation makes it easy to prune and for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again/">cut-and-come-again harvesting</a>. Head lettuce is difficult to grow outdoors in Singapore due to the heat and humidity, which tends to cause the tightly bunched leaves to rot.</p>
	<p>An <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#a">annual</a> crop, this plant is often grown and consumed under 2 months. Its rapid harvest cycle makes it useful for crop rotation.</p>
  <p>Due to its shallow root system, these plants are a popular choice for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">container gardening</a>.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
		<img title="Red and green loose-leaf lettuce grown in pots. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Horti%20techniques/ContainerPlanting_JacChua%20(3).jpg">
		<p>Lettuce does best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">more than 6 or more hours of indirect sunlight, or around 4-5 hours of direct sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 10cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe. Keep your plants cool with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">mulch</a> and plenty of water to encourage growth.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>

		<p><a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">Sow seeds</a> individually in a seedling tray filled with potting mix or seedling mix. Lightly mist the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within a week.</p>
		<p>The seedlings will be vulnerable to high heat and heavy rain and are best kept in a sheltered propagation area or a shaded space with around 4 hours of partial or direct sunlight.</p>

	<h4>Transplanting:</h4>
			<iframe allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" frameborder="0" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lItBHYjyrKg" height="415" width="100%"></iframe><br>
		<p>Seedlings will be ready for transplanting into pots or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a> when they have developed 4 or more leaves, or roughly a week or two after germination. Leave 10-20cm between each plant to encourage more growth, better ventilation, and prevent etiolation.</p>
	<br>
</section>
	
<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
		<p>Lettuce is a rapid grower and will produce more leaves if fed with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">high nitrogen fertilisers</a>. Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilised</a> regularly once every two weeks after transplanting for a fuller crop.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
				<iframe allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" frameborder="0" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f_Uoug7ZSeg" height="415" width="100%"></iframe><br>
		<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested for leaves</a> at any time, with younger leaves being the most tender. However, the leaves will become bitter when the plant starts to <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#flower">flower</a>. Most gardeners will <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvest</a> their crop around a month and a half after sowing.</p>

		<p>The whole plant can be harvested once by cutting the head at the base or multiple times by harvesting the older leaves as per the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again/">cut-and-come-again</a> method.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
		<p>Lettuce is primarily grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seeds. </a></p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
		<p><a href="/page-index/pests/caterpillars/">Caterpillars</a>, usually from the Diamondback moth and Tussock moth, can rapidly eat all the leaves of your plant. If your plant has lots of large holes and small brown or black poo pellets scattered around damaged leaves, you likely have a caterpillar infestation. Manually remove the caterpillars by hand and protect your plants with <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a>.</p>
		<p><a href="/page-index/pests/leaf-miner/">Leaf miners</a> are fly larvae that eat the leaves from the inside, leaving white lines or patches in their wake. Manually remove damaged leaves and use <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">fine mesh netting</a> to stop the adult flies from laying eggs on the plant again.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/etiolation/">Etiolation</a> is characterised by plants growing long and skinny, with weak stems and small leaves. The plants may also sometimes look yellowish. Plants etiolate when they do not get enough sunlight, which results in slow growth and untidy forms. To prevent this, grow plants in environments with enough light for them and make sure that each plant has enough space to prevent overcrowding.</p>
