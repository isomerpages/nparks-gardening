  <p>Lady’s-Fingers are a common crop in many Community Gardens, and are an easy plant for new edible gardeners to grow. The unripe pod of Lady’s-Finger can be eaten raw, but is often stir-fried or added to soup. The pod produces a juice with a mucus-like texture and is used to thicken soups and stews. </p>
  <p>Most varieties of Lady’s-Fingers are grown as an <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#a">annual</a>, but they have been also been grown as a <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop in Singapore.  </p>
  <p>This plant is part of the Malvaceae or Hibiscus family, which includes other edible plants like Roselles. </p>

  <h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
  <img title="Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/LadiesFinger_JacChua%20(1).jpg">
  <p>This plant does best in full sun gardens with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">a minimum of 6 hours of direct sunlight</a>.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> in containers that are at least 15cm deep, or in true ground. </p>

	<p>Lady’s-finger plants are pollinated by Woodborer bees, but most varieties are self-pollinated. </p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
<p>Sow seeds individually in a seedling tray filled with potting mix or seedling mix. Lightly mist the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within two weeks.</p>
	<iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7J87wY7U6s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>
	<p>The seedlings will be vulnerable to high heat and heavy rain and are best kept in a sheltered propagation area or a shaded space with around 4 hours of partial or direct sunlight. </p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Transplanting:</h4>
	<p>Seedlings will be ready for transplanting into pots or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a> when they have developed 4 or more leaves, or roughly a week or two after germination. Leave 15-30cm between each plant to encourage more growth and better ventilation. </p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Lady’s-Fingers will produce more flowers and thus more fruit when fed with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilised</a> regularly a month after germination for a fuller crop. </p>
	<p>It is a good practice to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune</a> regularly and remove dead leaves and stems to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant. Regular pruning also decreases the likelihood of pests quickly taking over the plant.</p> 
	<p>This plant can grow more than 2m tall, but for the ease of harvesting it can be pruned to a manageable hight of around 1m and continue to fruit. Taller plants can be <a href="/page-index/hardscape/staking/">staked</a> for additional support and prevent the stem from snapping.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for fruit pods around 2 months after sowing. The best time to harvest the fruit is in the early morning, before 9am. </p>
	<p>Only the immature pods of the Lady’s-Finger are edible. Harvest pods that are soft with bendable tips for better texture.</p>
	<p>Pods can be left on the plant to mature. Ripe pods are hard and woody and be harvested for seeds to be planted. </p>

  <h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Lady’s-Fingers are grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seeds/">seed</a>. </p>
	<br>

<section>
  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
  <p>If your plant has little to no flowers, you try fertilising the plant with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs">mealy bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot">root rot</a>, lack of sunlight, and <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiency">nutrient deficiencies</a>. </p>
	<p>This plant is prone to mildew during the wet season. Prune the plant regularly to increase airflow, and remove heavily affected leaves. </p>
