<p>Turmeric is an important spice in South Asian and Middle Eastern cuisine that adds a bittersweet flavour and bright yellow colour to curry. It is extracted from the <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#r">rhizome</a>, an underground horizontal stem that resembles a tuberous root. Turmeric is used to flavour and colour for curries, drinks and desserts. </p>
	<p>It is a medium <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop that readily grows in the tropics in both <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a> and in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a>. </p>
<p>Turmeric is part of the Zingiberaceae or Ginger family, which includes other popular edible plants like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/torch-ginger/">Torch Ginger</a> and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/sand-ginger/">Sand Ginger</a>.</p>

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
	<img title="Turmeric flowering in true ground. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/turmeric_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>Turmeric thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">2-6 hours of direct sunlight, but plants can also tolerate about 4-8 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 15cm deep, making them suitable for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">container gardening</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe. </p>
	<p>This plant will not do well in places with a lot of wind, like on rooftop gardens or corridor gardens on high floors. Protect the plant with other larger plants nearby to block off the wind.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Turmeric naturally grows in clusters as the plant grows more rhizomes. Thin plants out to give them around 5-10cm of space to encourage the production of more rhizomes.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<img title="Turmeric rhizomes on sale at a wet market. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/turmeric_root_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>Plants can be harvested for rhizomes at any time. They are typically harvested continuously via <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">division</a>.</p> 
	<p><b>Take note that the yellow sap can stain clothes and skin and is notoriously hard to remove. Use gloves and a gardening apron to avoid this.</b></p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Turmeric is propagated via <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">division</a> of the rhizome.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<img title="Turmeric plants wilting due to heat stress. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/turmeric_heatstress_jacquelinechua.jpg"> 
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss.</p>
		<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">wilted from heat stress</a>. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests.</p>
		<p>These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">sunburn</a> in more than 6 hours of direct sunlight. Use <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">shade netting</a> to protect your plants or replant in a shadier spot.</p>
