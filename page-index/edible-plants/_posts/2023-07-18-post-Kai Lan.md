	<p>Kai Lan is a versatile vegetable that has tender leaves and a thick, crunchy stem. It can be eaten blanched, steamed, or stir-fried. The flowers, stem and leaves are edible, and are a staple in many Chinese dishes. The sprouts can also be eaten as <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/microgreens">microgreens</a>!</p>
	<p>An <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#a">annual</a> crop, this plant is often grown and consumed under 2 months. Its rapid harvest cycle makes it useful for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/crop-rotation/">crop rotation</a>.</p>
  <p>Due to its shallow root system, these plants are a popular choice for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">container gardening</a>.</p>
	<p>Kai Lan is part of the Brassica or cabbage family, which also includes other popular vegetables like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/cai-xin/">Cai Xin</a> and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/xiao-bai-cai/">Xiao Bai Cai</a>.</p>

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
		<img title="Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/KaiLan_JacChua%20(1).jpg">
		<p>Kai Lan does best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">more than 6 or more hours of indirect sunlight, or around 4-5 hours of direct sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 10cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe.  Keep your plants cool with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">mulch</a> and plenty of water to encourage growth.</p>

		<p><a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">Sow seeds</a> individually in a seedling tray filled with potting mix or seedling mix. Lightly mist the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within a week.</p>
		<p>The seedlings will be vulnerable to high heat and heavy rain and are best kept in a sheltered propagation area or a shaded space with around 4 hours of partial or direct sunlight.</p>
	<p>The seedlings may be  eaten by <a href="/page-index/pests/snails-and-slugs/">snails</a> or <a href="/page-index/pests/pests/#birds">birds</a>.

	<h4>Transplanting:</h4>

		<p>Seedlings will be ready for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/transplanting/">transplanting</a> into pots or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a> when they have developed 4 or more leaves, or roughly a week or two after germination. Leave 10-20cm between each plant to encourage more growth.</p>
	<br>
</section>
	
<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
		<p>Kai Lan is a rapid grower and will produce more leaves if fed with high nitrogen fertilisers. Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilised</a> regularly once every two weeks after transplanting for a fuller crop.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>

		<p>Plants can be harvested for leaves and stems at any size, with younger leaves and stems being the most tender. Most gardeners will begin <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvesting</a> from Kai Lan around a month after sowing.</p>

		<p>The whole plant can be harvested once by cutting the whole stem at the base of the plant or harvested multiple times by using the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again/">cut-and-come-again</a> method by only cutting off the top 15-20cm of stem, or harvesting only the lower leaves.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
		<p>Kai Lan is primarily grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seeds</a>.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>Young plants have soft stems and can be completely eaten by <a href="/page-index/pests/snails-and-slugs/">slugs and snails</a>. Grow seedlings till they are at least 10cm tall before planting them in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>, or use DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches/">cloches</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a> to protect young plants. </p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/caterpillars/">Caterpillars</a>, usually from the Diamondback moth and Tussock moth, can rapidly eat all the leaves of your plant. If your plant has lots of large holes and small brown or black poo pellets scattered around damaged leaves, you likely have a caterpillar infestation. Manually remove the caterpillars by hand and protect your plants with netting.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/leaf-miner/">Leaf miners</a> are fly larvae that eat the leaves from the inside, leaving white lines or patches in their wake. Manually remove damaged leaves and use fine mesh netting to stop the adult flies from laying eggs on the plant again.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/etiolation/">Etiolation</a> is characterised by plants growing long and skinny, with weak stems and small leaves. The plants may also sometimes look yellowish. Plants etiolate when they do not get enough sunlight, which results in slow growth and untidy forms. To prevent this, grow plants in environments with enough light for them and make sure that each plant has enough space to prevent overcrowding.</p>
	<p>These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">sunburn</a> in more than 6 hours of direct sunlight. Use <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">shade netting</a> to protect your plants or replant in a shadier spot.</p>
