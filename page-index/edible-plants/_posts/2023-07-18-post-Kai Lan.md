	<p>Kai Lan is a versatile vegetable that has tender leaves and a thick, crunchy stem. It can be eaten blanched, steamed, or stir-fried. The flowers, stem and leaves are edible, and are a staple in many Chinese dishes.</p>
	<p>An <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#a">annual</a> crop, this plant is often grown and consumed under 2 months. Its rapid harvest cycle makes it useful for crop rotation.</p>
	<p>Due to its shallow root system, these plants are a popular choice for container gardening and corridor gardening.</p>
	<p>Kai Lan is part of the Brassica or cabbage family, which also includes other popular vegetables like Cai Xin and Xiao Bai Cai.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
		<img title="Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/KaiLan_JacChua%20(1).jpg">
		<p>Kai Lan does best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">more than 6 or more hours of indirect sunlight, or around 4-5 hours of direct sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 10cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe. Keep your plants cool with mulch and plenty of water to encourage growth.</p>
	<br>

<section>
  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
		<p><a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">Sow seeds</a> individually in a seedling tray filled with potting mix or seedling mix. Lightly mist the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within a week.</p>
		<iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7J87wY7U6s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>	<br>
		<p>The seedlings will be vulnerable to high heat and heavy rain and are best kept in a sheltered propagation area or a shaded space with around 4 hours of partial or direct sunlight.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Transplanting:</h4>
		<p>Seedlings will be ready for transplanting into pots or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a> when they have developed 4 or more leaves, or roughly a week or two after germination. Leave 10-20cm between each plant to encourage more growth, better ventilation, and prevent etiolation.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
		<p>Kai Lan is a rapid grower and will produce more leaves and thicker stems if fed with high nitrogen fertilisers. Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilised</a> regularly the week after transplanting for a fuller crop.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
		<p>Plants can be harvested for leaves and stems at any size, with younger leaves and stems being the most tender. Most gardeners will begin <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvesting</a> from Kai Lan around a month after sowing.</p>
		<p>The whole plant can be harvested once by cutting the whole stem at the base of the plant or harvested multiple times by using the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again/">cut-and-come-again</a> method by only cutting off the top 15-20cm of stem, ore harvesting only the lower leaves.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
		<p>Kai Lan is primarily grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seeds</a>.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/caterpillars/">Caterpillars</a>, usually from the Diamondback moth and Tussock moth, can rapidly eat all the leaves of your plant. If your plant has lots of large holes and small brown or black poo pellets scattered around damaged leaves, you likely have a caterpillar infestation. Manually remove the caterpillars by hand and protect your plants with netting.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/leaf-miner/">Leaf miners</a> are fly larvae that eat the leaves from the inside, leaving white lines or patches in their wake. Manually remove damaged leaves and use <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">fine mesh netting</a> to stop the adult flies from laying eggs on the plant again.</p>
		<p>Etiolation is characterised by plants growing long and skinny, with weak stems and small leaves. The plants may also sometimes look yellowish. Plants etiolate when they do not get enough sunlight, which results in slow growth and untidy forms. To prevent this, grow plants in environments with enough light for them and make sure that each plant has enough space to prevent overcrowding.</p>
