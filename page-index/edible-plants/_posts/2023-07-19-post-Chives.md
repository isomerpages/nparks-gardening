	<p><strong>Other common names:</strong> Garlic Chives, Chinese Leeks, Chinese Chives, Flat Chives, Oriental Garlic, 韭菜</p>

<p>Chives are an easy herb that grows in both semi-shade and full sun gardens, and is a popular choice for small and upcycled containers due to its shallow roots. Chives are usually harvested for their leaves, but all parts of the plant generally taste like garlic and can be added to stir-fries, salads, and soups.</p>
<p>A perennial crop with shallow root, chives are a useful addition to any edible garden, and are often planted in containers and corridor gardens. </p>
<p>Chives are part of the Amaryllidaceae or onion family, which includes other popular herbs like shallots and leeks.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
<p>As with most herbs, Chives need about 4-6 hours of direct sunlight or 6-8 hours of indirect sunlight. This plant will grow faster in direct sunlight but will tolerate shadier conditions. Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 5cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe. </p>

	<br>
	
<p>As with all members of the Nightshade family, this plant is buzz pollinated and produces the most fruit when bees are around to pollinate it. Growing more bee-attracting plants within the garden will encourage pollination. It can be hand-pollinated, but the success rate is generally lower. </p>
<p>These plants can get blossom end rot, which shows up as dark, sunken blotches at the end of fruits. It is a symptom of a lack of calcium reaching the fruit, which is usually caused by a lack of water or inconsistent watering. Keep your soil moist but not waterlogged and take care to water more often during the dry season. </p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
<p>Sow seeds individually in a seedling tray filled with potting mix or seedling mix. Lightly mist the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within two weeks.</p>
<p>Chilli seeds harvested fresh from ripe fruit are covered in capsaicin oil, which can cause a burning sensation when in contact with the skin, eyes, and lips. Handle fresh chilli seeds with gloves and avoid touching your face to prevent this.</p>

	<br>

<p>The seedlings will be vulnerable to high heat and heavy rain and are best kept in a sheltered propagation area or a shaded space with around 4 hours of partial or direct sunlight. </p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Transplanting:</h4>
<p>Seedlings will be ready for transplanting into pots or true ground when they have developed 4 or more leaves, or roughly a week or two after germination. Leave 15-30cm between each plant to encourage more growth and better ventilation. </p>
<br>
</section>
	
<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
<p>Chillies will produce more flowers and thus more fruit when fed with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. Plants can be fertilised regularly a month after germination for a fuller crop. </p>
<p>Shoot tips can be pruned off when the plant is around 30cm tall to encourage branching, with more branches bearing more fruit. </p>
<p>It is a good practice to prune regularly and remove dead leaves and stems to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant. Regular pruning also decreases the likelihood of pests quickly taking over the plant. </p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Plants can be harvested for fruits around 3 months after sowing. The best time to harvest the fruit is in the early morning, before 9am.</p>
<p>Both immature and mature Chilli fruits can be eaten and may vary in taste depending on their stage of ripening. 
Chilli fruits can be left to ripen and dry on the plant. Dry Chillies can be harvested for seeds to be planted.</p>

<p>Chillies are hot because they produce capsaicin oil, which can cause skin irritation. Very hot varieties like the Carolina Reaper and Ghost pepper can cause acute pain if handled carelessly. Use gloves while harvesting fruits and avoid touching your face when handling Chillies.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Chillies are grown from seed. </p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p>If your plant has little to no flowers, you try fertilising the plant with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>
<p>Many plants require pollinators to help them fruit. Bees, butterflies, birds and even beetles transport pollen from one flower to another, pollinating your crops and increasing their fruit yield. Attract some pollinators to your garden by growing pollinator-attracting crops, or become a pollinator yourself by hand-pollinating your plants. </p>
<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies. </p>
<p>Fruit flies can lay eggs in the fruit, resulting in larvae damaging the fruit and creating spots on the skin. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off. </p>
<p>Wilting leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss. </p>
<p>These plants can get blossom end rot, which shows up as dark, sunken blotches at the end of fruits. It is a symptom of a lack of calcium reaching the fruit, which is usually caused by a lack of water or inconsistent watering. Keep your soil moist but not waterlogged and take care to water more often during the dry season.</p>
