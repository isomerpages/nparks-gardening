	<p>Winged Beans are a hardy crop commonly found in Southeast Asian gardens. Young leaves, stems, and immature fruit can be eaten raw, stir-fried, steamed or boiled. The flowers can also be boiled to extract colouring for a variety of food products.</p>
	<p>An annual crop, these plants are often grown in rotation with other fruiting climbers.</p>
	<p>This plant is very heat and drought tolerant, making it suitable for most edible gardens, rooftop gardens, permaculture gardens and low-maintenance beds.</p>
	<p>This plant is part of the 	Fabaceae or Bean family, which includes other popular edible fruits like Long Bean, Peanut, and Sword bean. All members of the bean family can be used for companion planting as they can fix nitrogen into the soil.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<img title="Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/WingedBean_JacChua%20(2).jpg">
	<p>This vine does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight. It can also grow in gardens with more than 4 hours of direct sunlight or at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but it may grow slower and produce less fruit.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="https://staging.dmhtu0pi4p9u7.amplifyapp.com/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 30cm deep, or in true ground. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your soil drains well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe. Keep your plants cool with mulch and plenty of water to encourage growth.</p>
	<p>As a fast-growing vine, this plant can be grown on the ground or trained up a sturdy trellis.</p>

	<br>
	<p>As with all members of the bean family, this plant is pollinated by bees. Growing more bee-attracting plants within the garden will encourage pollination. If your garden lacks bees, the plant can also be hand pollinated.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15-30cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 10 days.</p>

<br>
	<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY cloche or netting.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Bean plants generally don’t require much fertilising because they are able to fix their own nitrogen.</p>
	<p>Because the vines will grow on top of each other, it is a good practice to prune regularly and remove dead leaves and vines to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be harvested for fruits around 2 months after sowing. The best time to harvest the fruit is in the early morning, before 9am.</p>
	<p>Only green, immature beans can be eaten. Dry, brown pods are mature, and can be used for seeds.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>This vine can be grown via seeds. Seeds can be taken from mature fruit for immediate planting.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
	<p>Whiteflies can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray.</p>
<p>Wilting leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss.</p>
