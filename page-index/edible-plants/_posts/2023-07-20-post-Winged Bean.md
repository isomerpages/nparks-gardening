	<p>Winged Beans are a hardy crop commonly found in Southeast Asian gardens. Young leaves, stems, and immature fruit can be eaten raw, stir-fried, steamed or boiled. The flowers can also be boiled to extract colouring for a variety of food products.</p>
	<p>An <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#a">annual</a> crop, these plants are often grown in rotation with other fruiting climbers.</p>
	<p>This plant is very heat and drought tolerant, making it suitable for most edible gardens, rooftop gardens, permaculture gardens and low-maintenance beds.</p>
	<p>This plant is part of the 	Fabaceae or Bean family, which includes other popular edible fruits like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/long-bean/">Long Bean</a>, <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/peanut/">Peanut</a>, and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/sword-bean/">Sword bean</a>. All members of the bean family can be used for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/companion-planting/">companion planting</a> as they can fix nitrogen into the soil.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<img title="Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/WingedBean_JacChua%20(2).jpg">
	<p>This vine does best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight</a>. It can also grow in gardens with more than 4 hours of direct sunlight or at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but it may grow slower and produce less fruit.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 30cm deep, or in true ground. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your soil drains well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe. Keep your plants cool with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">mulch</a> and plenty of water to encourage growth.</p>
	<p>As a fast-growing vine, this plant can be grown on the ground or trained up a sturdy <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/trellis/">trellis.</a></p>
	<p>As with all members of the bean family, this plant is pollinated by bees. Growing more <a href="/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants/">bee-attracting plants</a> within the garden will encourage <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">pollination</a>. If your garden lacks bees, the plant can also be hand pollinated.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15-30cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 10 days.</p>

<br>
	<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches/">cloche</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a>.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Bean plants generally do not require much fertilising because they are able to fix their own nitrogen.</p>
	<p>Because the vines will grow on top of each other, it is a good practice to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune regularly</a> and remove dead leaves and vines to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for fruits around 2 months after sowing. The best time to harvest the fruit is in the early morning, before 9am.</p>
	<p>Only green, immature beans can be eaten. Dry, brown pods are mature, and can be used for seeds.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>This vine can be grown <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seeds/">via seeds</a>. Seeds can be taken from mature fruit for immediate planting.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p>If your plant has few to no flowers, you can fertilise the plant with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers high in phosphorus and potassium</a>. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>	
<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like root rot. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">mulch</a> at the base to prevent water loss.</p>
