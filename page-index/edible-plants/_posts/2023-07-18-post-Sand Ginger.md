  <p> Sand Gingers are a small, aromatic spice used in Malaysian and Indonesian cooking. Its leaves can be consumed raw or in soups, and its <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#r">rhizome</a> is often pounded into a powder and used to flavour sauces and curries.</p>
	<p>It is a small <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop that readily grows in the tropics in both <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a> and in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a>. This is a common plant in herb gardens, and is sometimes used as a <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/companion-planting/">living mulch as part of companion planting</a>.</p>
	<p>Sand Gingers are part of the Zingiberaceae or Ginger family, which includes other popular edible plants like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/torch-ginger/">Torch Ginger</a> and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/fingerroot/">Fingerroot</a>.</p>

   <p> Sand Ginger thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">more than 2- 4 hours of direct sun or 4-6 hours of indirect sun</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 10cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">inorganic soil amendments</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Sand Ginger naturally grows in clusters as the plant grows more <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#r">rhizomes</a>. Thin plants out to give them around 5-10cm of space to encourage the production of more rhizomes.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<img title="Sand Gingers that are sunburned due to being exposed to too much sunlight. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/sandginger_sunburn_jacquelinechua.jpg">
  <p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, or move it to a shadier part of the garden.</p>
	<p>Plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">sunburn</a> in more than 4 hours of direct sunlight. Use <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">shade netting</a> to protect your plants or replant in a shadier spot.</p>
