	<p>Elephant Foot Yam is a large crop with edible root known as a corm which is used in curries, stews, chips or pickles. Young leaves are also cooked and eaten as a vegetable.</p>
	<p>This plant is typically grown as an <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#a">annual</a> crop, but if the main <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#c">corm</a> is left intact, it can grow back as a <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a>.</p>
	<p>Elephant Foot Yams are part of the Araceae or Aroid family, which includes other edible plants like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/taro">Taro</a>. Many ornamental members of the family are very popular as houseplants, including Monsteras and <a href="/page-index/ornamental-plants/devils-ivy">Devil’s Ivy</a>.</p>

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
	<p>Elephant Foot Yam grows well in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">2-4 hours of direct sunlight or more than 6 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. This plant will not do well in places with a lot of sun and is vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">sunburn</a>.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 60cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to<a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot"> root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4>
	<img title="Elephants foot yam growing in a pot. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/elephantfootyam%20(2)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>Elephant Foot Yams grow as singular leaf stalks that fan out into an umbrella-shaped canopy like a small tree. Its large size can crowd out nearby plants, so it is best planted by itself in an area of 2 meters by 2 meters.</p>
	<p>The leaf stalk may die back after some time, and the corm will produce a new one. The plant will also produce additional small corms around itself, which can be harvested for replanting or for consumption.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for corms and young leaflets at any time. The corms are typically harvested via division, while leaflets are harvested via the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again">cut-and-come-again method</a>. The plant takes up to a year to produce new corms for harvest.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily or add mulch to prevent water loss.</p>
	<p>This plant is susceptible to nematodes which cause the plant to have galls on its roots which result in leaf wilting and root decay. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/crop-rotation">Rotate your crops</a> and change the soil to remedy the infestation.</p>
