	<p>Guava trees are common fruit trees in home and community gardens as they can grow in a wide range of soils and produce fruit all year long. Guava fruits are typically eaten raw, processed into desserts or candy, or drunk as a juice.</p>
	<p>As a <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> tree, it is a common sight in edible gardens.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>This tree does best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light">full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight</a>. This plant can also grow in areas with at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but growth will be slow and the plant will produce less fruits.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 50cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. This tree is highly tolerant of a wide variety of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/"> soil types</a>, from sandy to clayey.</p>
	<p>This tree can grow up to 10m high. The tree is best maintained at roughly 2m high for easy maintenance and harvesting.</p>

	<h4>Sowing Seeds</h4>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground. Because the plant eventually grows into a tree, it is easier to grow a few seedlings in separate pots before selecting the healthiest one to be grown in true ground.</p>
	<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches">cloche</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting">netting</a>.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Guava trees are steady growers but do benefit from being fed high potassium and phosphorus <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising">fertilisers</a> to encourage flowering and thus fruiting. Regular <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a>
	</p><p>The tree will need to be around 5 years old before it starts producing fruit if grown from seed.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Fruits are considered ripe when they are slightly soft to the touch but are not mushy. Ripe fruits will also have a strong, sweet fragrance. Fruits can be harvested unripe then left to ripen off the tree or harvested ripe for immediate consumption.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>This tree is grown via seed, or via woody cuttings with rooting hormone.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>If your plant has little to no flowers, you try fertilising the plant with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>
	<p>Many plants require pollinators to help them fruit. Bees, butterflies, birds and even beetles transport pollen from one flower to another, pollinating your crops and increasing their fruit yield. Attract some pollinators to your garden by growing pollinator-attracting crops, or become a pollinator yourself by hand-pollinating your plants.</p>
	<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
	<p>Whiteflies can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray. 
Fruit flies can lay eggs in the fruit, resulting in larvae damaging the fruit and creating spots on the skin. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off.</p>
	<p>Squirrels, birds and fruit bats may eat unripe or ripe fruit. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off.</p>
