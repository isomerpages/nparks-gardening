<section>
	<p>White Mulberry trees are a common addition to Southeast Asian edible gardens and produce edible leaves and fruit. The leaves can be dried and made into tea, while the ripe and unripe fruits are eaten raw or part of desserts.</p>
	<p>As a perennial tree, it is a common sight in edible gardens, permaculture gardens, and low maintenance beds.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>This tree does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 30cm deep, or in true ground. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe. Keep your plants cool with mulch and plenty of water to encourage growth.</p>
	<p>This tree can grow up to 15m high. The tree is best maintained at roughly 1.5m high for easy maintenance and harvesting.</p>
	<p>This plant can be grown year-round.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Mulberry trees are rapid growers and generally do not require fertilising. Regular hard pruning will keep the plant at a manageable size and encourage fruiting.</p>
	<p>The tree will need to be around 4 years old before it starts producing fruit if grown from seed. Rooted cuttings can produce fruit after a month if taken from a mature tree.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Plants can be harvested for leaves at any time. Regular harvesting will encourage bushier growth and will keep the plant at a manageable height. </p>
<p>Mature, black fruits can be harvested for seeds. Sow seeds from ripe fruit immediately after harvesting as they tend to rot quickly.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Curry Leaf Plants can be grown from seed or propagated via woody stem cuttings. Woody stem cuttings should be dipped in rooting hormone before being potted up in rooting media. </p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>Like most strong-smelling herbs, this plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
<p>This plant is vulnerable to fungal diseases that form leaf spots during the wet season or when the plant is overgrown. Increase air circulation with regular pruning and remove affected leaves to reduce the spread.</p>
<p>Aphids, may infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
