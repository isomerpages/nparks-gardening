<p>Sweet Potatoes are a versatile crop that produces both edible leaves and tubers, both of which are popular ingredients in a wide variety of Asian dishes. The leaves come in a range of shapes and colours including deep purple, neon yellow and green. Some of these attractive varieties such as the ‘Black Heart’ and ‘Margarita’ can be used to add a pop of colour to the garden.</p>
<p>This fast-growing perennial crop can be used as an edible groundcover or a green mulch to suppress weeds and protect soil from the sun and rain.</p>
<p>This vine is from the Ipomoea or Morning Glory family, and in the same genus as Kang Kong.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>

<p>This vine thrives in both full and partial sun gardens and grows best with 4-8 hours of direct sunlight, but can also grow in 4- 6 hours of indirect sunlight but at a slower pace.</p>
<p>Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 30cm deep, or in true ground. The plant can be grown in smaller pots about 10cm deep but will not produce large tubers. Tuber growth can be encouraged by adding lots of organic material to the soil, making it soft.</p>
<p>This plant does best when watered regularly but will not survive waterlogging. It can tolerate drought for short periods of time, but the lack of water will reduce its growth.</p>
<p>As a fast-growing vine, this plant is traditionally left to sprawl on large patches of soil, but it can be also grown up a trellis. Regular pruning will encourage additional growth and improve air circulation.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
<p>This plant is typically grown from tubers or stem cuttings rooted in water or soil, but it can also be grown from seeds. </p>
<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 10cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within a week.

<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY cloche or netting.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
<p>Sweet potato grows leaves and stems rapidly when fed with high nitrogen fertilisers, but this discourages it from growing tubers. Plants can be fertilised for the first two weeks after planting to help with its initial growth, and then left on its own to grow tubers after.</p>
<p>Because the vines will grow on top of each other, it is a good practice to prune regularly to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant. Take note that the plant produces a milky sap when cut, and that the sap can irritate skin. Use gloves when pruning to protect your hands, and do not touch your face after handling cuttings with sap. </p>
<p>This vine grows large very rapidly and can climb up to 4m if a tall enough surface is available. Prune it back to manageable heights to make harvesting and maintenance easier.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Plants can be harvested for leaves and stems, with younger leaves being the most tender. Most gardeners will begin harvesting leaves and stems from their Sweet Potato plant around two months after sowing from seed or after planting cuttings or tubers. Take note that the plant produces a milky sap when cut, and that the sap can irritate skin. Use gloves when pruning and harvesting leaves. </p>
<p>Tubers will take at least two months to form after the plant starts to produce vines, provided that the soil is soft and deep enough. Tubers can be left for up to 6 months to grow, after which they tend to be too tough and fibrous for eating. </p>
<p>Sweet potato is typically harvested multiple times by harvesting the younger leaves and stems as per the cut-and-come-again method. This plant can live for several years if cared for properly and will continue to produce new growth year round.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Lettuce is primarily grown from seeds. </p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p>Caterpillars, usually from the Diamondback moth and Tussock moth, can rapidly eat all the leaves of your plant. If your plant has lots of large holes and small brown or black poo pellets scattered around damaged leaves, you likely have a caterpillar infestation. Manually remove the caterpillars by hand and protect your plants with netting.</p>
<p>Leaf miners are fly larvae that eat the leaves from the inside, leaving white lines or patches in their wake. Manually remove damaged leaves and use fine mesh netting to stop the adult flies from laying eggs on the plant again.</p>
<p>Etiolation is characterised by plants growing long and skinny, with weak stems and small leaves. The plants may also sometimes look yellowish. Plants etiolate when they do not get enough sunlight, which results in slow growth and untidy forms. To prevent this, grow plants in environments with enough light for them and make sure that each plant has enough space to prevent overcrowding.</p>
