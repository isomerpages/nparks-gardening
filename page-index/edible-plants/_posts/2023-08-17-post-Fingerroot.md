		<p>Fingerroot produces a spice extracted from the <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#r">rhizome</a>, and can be used raw or processed into a  powder or a paste to flavour soups, meat, and pickles. The young shoots can also be eaten raw in salads. It is named as such because its roots look like a bunch of fingers.</p>
	<p>It is also commonly called Chinese ginger, although it is not in the same genus as true ginger (<em>Zingiber officinate</em>).</p>
	<p>It is a medium <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop that readily grows in the tropics in both <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground">true ground</a> and <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers">in pots</a>.</p>
	<p>Fingerroot is part of the Zingiberaceae or Ginger family, which includes other popular edible plants like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/torch-ginger">Torch Ginger</a> and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/turmeric">Turmeric</a>.</p>

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
	<p>Fingerroot grows well in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-6 hours of direct sunlight or 6-8 hours of indirect sunlight</a>.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 15cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>
	<p>This plant will not do well in places with a lot of wind, like on rooftop gardens or corridor gardens on high floors. Protect the plant with other larger plants nearby to block off the wind.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Fingerroot naturally grows in clusters as the plant grows more rhizomes. Thin plants out to give them around 5-10cm of space to encourage the production of more rhizomes.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for rhizomes at any time. They are typically harvested continuously via division.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Fingerroot is propagated <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">via division</a> of the rhizome.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>This plant’s leaves may develop <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/sunburn/">sunburn</a> if exposed to too much sunlight. Prevent sunburn by planting it in shade or cover it with <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting">shade netting</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">Spider Mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
		<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, or move it to a shadier part of the garden.</p>
