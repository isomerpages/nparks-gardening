<section>
			<p>Fingerroot produces a spice extracted from the rhizome, an underground horizontal stem that resembles a tuberous root. The root can be used raw or processed into a  powder or a paste to flavour soups, meat, and pickles. The young shoots can also be eaten raw in salads. It is named as such because its roots look like a bunch of fingers.</p>
	<p>It is also commonly called Chinese ginger, although it is not in the same genus as true ginger (Zingiber officinate).</p>
	<p>It is a medium perennial crop that readily grows in the tropics in both true ground and in pots.</p>
	<p>Fingerroot is part of the Zingiberaceae or Ginger family, which includes other popular edible plants like Torch Ginger and Tumeric.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>Elephant Foot Yam grows well in 2-4 hours of direct sunlight or more than 6 hours of indirect sunlight. Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 60cm deep, making them most suitable for true ground planting. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe.</p>
	<p>This plant will not do well in places with a lot of sun and is vulnerable to sunburn.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Elephant Foot Yams grow as singular leaf stalks that fan out into an umbrella-shaped canopy like a small tree. Its large size can crowd out nearby plants, so it is best planted by itself in an area of 2 meters by 2 meters. The leaf stalk may die back after some time, and the corm will produce a new one. The plant will also produce additional small corms around itself, which can be harvested for replanting or for consumption.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be harvested for corms and young leaflets at any time. The corms are typically harvested via division, while leaflets are harvested via the cut-and-come-again method. The plant takes up to a year to produce new corms for harvest.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Elephant Foot Yams are propagated via division of the corm.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>Wilting leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily or add mulch to prevent water loss.</p>
	<p>This plant is susceptible to nematodes which cause the plant to have galls on its roots which result in leaf wilting and root decay. Rotate your crops and change the soil to remedy the infestation.</p>
