	<h3>Fingerroot (<em>Boesenbergia rotunda</em>)</h3>

<section>
	<p><strong>Other common names:</strong> Chinese ginger, Chinese key, 凹唇姜</p>
	<br>

<section>
		<p>Fingerroot produces a spice extracted from the <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#r">rhizome</a>, an underground horizontal stem that resembles a tuberous root. The root can be used raw or processed into a  powder or a paste to flavour soups, meat, and pickles. The young shoots can also be eaten raw in salads. It is named as such because its roots look like a bunch of fingers.</p>
	<p>It is also commonly called Chinese ginger, although it is not in the same genus as true ginger (Zingiber officinate).</p>
	<p>It is a medium <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop that readily grows in the tropics in both <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground">true ground</a> and <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers">in pots</a>.</p>
	<p>Fingerroot is part of the Zingiberaceae or Ginger family, which includes other popular edible plants like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/torch-ginger">Torch Ginger</a> and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/turmeric">Turmeric.</a></p><a href="/page-index/edible-plants/turmeric">

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	</a><p><a href="/page-index/edible-plants/turmeric">Fingerroot grows well in </a><a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light">4-6 hours of direct sunlight or 6-8 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil">moist, well-drained soil</a> at least 15cm deep, making them suitable for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-container">container gardening</a> and corridor gardening. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>
	<p>This plant will not do well in places with a lot of wind, like on rooftop gardens or corridor gardens on high floors. Protect the plant with other larger plants nearby to block off the wind.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Fingerroot naturally grows in clusters as the plant grows more rhizomes. Thin plants out to give them around 5-10cm of space to encourage the production of more rhizomes.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene">harvested</a> for rhizomes at any time. They are typically harvested continuously via division.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Fingerroot is propagated <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division">via division</a> of the rhizome.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, or move it to a shadier part of the garden.</p>
	<p>This plant’s leaves may develop brown, dry patches if exposed to too much sunlight. Prevent sun burn by planting it in shade or cover it with <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting">shade netting</a>.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs">mealy bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning">Prune off</a> the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot">root rot</a>, lack of sunlight, and <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiencies">nutrient deficiencies.</a></p>
