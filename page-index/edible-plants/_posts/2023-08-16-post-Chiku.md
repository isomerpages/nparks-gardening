	<p>Chiku trees are a popular and hardy tropical fruit that grows in a variety of soil types, including notoriously poor ones. The fruit is traditionally eaten raw, and the sap was harvested to make chewing gum before the invention of synthetic substitutes.</p>
	<p>As a <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> tree, it is a common sight in edible gardens, permaculture gardens, and low maintenance beds.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>This tree does best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight</a>. It can also be grown in 6 or more hours of indirect sunlight, but growth will be slower and the tree may produce less fruits.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">moist, well-drained soil</a> at least 50cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe. Root rot and poor drainage will also lead to a poor fruit yield. This tree is drought-tolerant and can also tolerate salty soil.</p>
	<p>This tree can grow up to 30m high, and usually has a broad crown. The tree is best maintained at roughly 3m high for easy maintenance and harvesting.</p>

	<h4>Sowing Seeds</h4>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground. Because the plant eventually grows into a tree, it is easier to grow a few seedlings in separate pots before selecting the healthiest one to be grown in true ground.</p>

	<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches/">cloche</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a>.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Chiku trees are steady growers but do benefit from being fed high potassium and phosphorus <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers</a> to encourage flowering and thus fruiting. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regular pruning</a> to promote airflow will keep the plant healthy and neat. <b>Cut stems will produce sap that can irritate the skin.</b> Wear gloves while maintaining the plant to prevent this.</p>
	<p>The tree will need to be around 5 years old before it starts producing fruit if grown from seed. Air-layered plants take around 2 years to fruit.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Fruits are ripe when the brown skin becomes slightly wrinkly and soft. Mushy fruits are over-ripe. Fruits can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> unripe then left to ripen off the tree, or harvested ripe for immediate consumption. Fresh fruit and cut stems will produce sap that can irritate the skin. Harvest the fruit while wearing gloves to prevent this.</p>
	<p><b>Seeds can induce vomiting when ingested and should be removed before serving</b>.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>This tree is grown <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seeds/">via seed</a>, or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">via woody cuttings</a> with rooting hormone.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>If your plant has little to no flowers, you try <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilising</a> the plant with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>
	<p>Many plants require pollinators to help them fruit. Bees, butterflies, birds and even beetles transport pollen from one flower to another, <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p/">pollinating</a> your crops and increasing their fruit yield. Attract some pollinators to your garden by growing <a href="/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants/">pollinator-attracting crops</a>, or become a pollinator yourself by hand-pollinating your plants.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">mealy bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Prune off</a> the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, lack of sunlight, and <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiencies/">nutrient deficiencies</a>.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a> can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray.</p> 
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/oriental-fruit-flies/">Fruit flies</a> can lay eggs in the fruit, resulting in larvae damaging the fruit and creating spots on the skin. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off.</p>
	<p>Squirrels, birds and fruit bats may eat unripe or ripe fruit. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off.</p>
