	<p>Belimbing trees are small fruit trees that produce numerous small, oblong green fruits that are very sour. The fruits can be eaten raw as a relish, stewed with chilli, or blended into sauces. Its numerous flowers are very attractive to bees and butterflies.</p>
	<p>As a perennial tree, it is a common sight in edible gardens, permaculture gardens, and low maintenance beds.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>This tree does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 50cm deep, or in true ground. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe.</p>
	<p>This tree can grow up to 10m high, but because the fruits form along the stem, it is best to prune it down to around 2 or 3m for easy harvesting.</p>
 <p>This plant can be grown year-round.</p>

	<h4>Sowing Seeds</h4>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground. Because the plant eventually grows into a tree, it is easier to grow a few seedlings in separate pots before selecting the healthiest one to be grown in true ground.</p>

	<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY cloche or netting.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Belimbing trees are steady growers and generally does not need fertilising. The tree can grow up to 10m high but because the fruits form along the stems and trunk, it is best to prune it down to around 1.5-3m for easy harvesting. Regular pruning to promote airflow will keep the plant healthy and neat.</p>
	<p>The tree will need to be around 4 years old before it starts producing fruit.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Young leaves can be harvested at any time.</p>
	<p>Ripe fruits are pink, dark purple or white, depending on the variety. Ripe fruits should be harvested for immediate consumption.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>This tree can be grown via seed but are usually propagated via woody cuttings with rooting hormone.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
	<p>Whiteflies can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray.</p>
	<p>Squirrels, birds and fruit bats may eat unripe or ripe fruit. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off.</p>
