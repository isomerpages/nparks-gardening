	<p>White Mulberry trees are a common addition to Southeast Asian edible gardens and produce edible leaves and fruit. The leaves can be dried and made into tea, while the ripe and unripe fruits are eaten raw or part of desserts.</p>
	<p>As a perennial tree, it is a common sight in edible gardens, permaculture gardens, and low maintenance beds.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>This tree does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="https://staging.dmhtu0pi4p9u7.amplifyapp.com/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 30cm deep, or in true ground. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe. Keep your plants cool with mulch and plenty of water to encourage growth.</p>
	<p>This tree can grow up to 15m high. The tree is best maintained at roughly 1.5m high for easy maintenance and harvesting.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4>

	<p>Mulberry trees are rapid growers and generally do not require fertilising. Regular hard pruning will keep the plant at a manageable size and encourage fruiting.</p>
	<p>The tree will need to be around 4 years old before it starts producing fruit if grown from seed. Rooted cuttings can produce fruit after a month if taken from a mature tree.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Young leaves can be harvested at any time.</p>
	<p>Ripe fruits are pink, dark purple or white, depending on the variety. Ripe fruits should be harvested for immediate consumption.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>This tree can be grown via seed but are usually propagated via woody cuttings with rooting hormone.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
	<p>Whiteflies can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray.</p>
	<p>Squirrels, birds and fruit bats may eat unripe or ripe fruit. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off.</p>
