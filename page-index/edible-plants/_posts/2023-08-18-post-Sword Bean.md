<section>
	<p>Sword Beans are impressive vines that produce bean pods that can be up to 35cm long and 6cm wide, resembling the blade of a sword. Young pods, leaves and stems can be eaten raw, steamed or boiled. Mature beans can also be eaten but should be boiled in at least two changes of water and have their seed coats removed due to toxic proteins within the mature seeds.</p>
	<p>As a <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> vine, it is a common sight in edible gardens, permaculture gardens, and low maintenance beds.</p> 
	<p>This plant is part of the 	Fabaceae or Bean family, which includes other popular edible fruits like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/winged-bean/">Winged Bean</a>, <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/peanut/">Peanut</a>, and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/long-bean/">Long bean</a>.  All members of the bean family can be used for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/companion-planting/">companion planting</a> as they can fix nitrogen into the soil.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>TThis vine does best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight</a>. It can also grow in areas with at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight but will produce less fruit.
		</p><p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">moist, well-drained soil</a> at least 30cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>.</p>
	<p>This vine is vulnerable to heat stress during the dry season. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering/">Water it regularly</a> and <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">mulch</a> the base to prevent water loss.</p>
	<p>As a fast-growing vine, this plant can be grown on the ground or trained up a sturdy <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/trellises/">trellis</a>. The fruits are quite long and often exceed 30cm, so they do best on tall trellises.</p>

	<p>As with all members of the bean family, this plant is pollinated by bees. Growing more <a href="/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants/">bee-attracting plants</a> within the garden will encourage pollination. If your garden lacks bees, the plant can also be hand pollinated.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15-30cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 10 days. </p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Bean plants generally do not require much fertilising because they are able to fix their own nitrogen.</p>
	<p>Because the vines will grow on top of each other, it is a good practice to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune regularly</a> and remove dead leaves and vines to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for young leaves and stems or immature fruits at any time.</p>
	<p>Pods are mature when they turn dry and brown. <b>The pink beans can only be eaten after being boiled at least twice, with water being changed each time.</b> Beans from mature pods can also be used for future planting.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>This vine can be grown via seeds. Seeds can be taken from mature fruit for immediate planting.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
	<p>Whiteflies can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray.</p>
	<p>Wilting leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss.</p>
