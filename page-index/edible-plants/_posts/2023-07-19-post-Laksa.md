<p>Laksa is an aromatic herb that is used to flavour soups and is the most important spice in its namesake dish. It is highly tolerant of heat and heavy rain, making it an easy herb for most gardeners to grow in Singapore. </p>
<p>Laksa plants are typically treated as annual crops as older plants tend to get leggy and untidy. However, they can also be kept as perennials if they are hard pruned regularly. </p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
<p>This tree does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 50cm deep, or in true ground. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe. Keep your plants cool with mulch and plenty of water to encourage growth.</p>
<p>This tree can grow up to 12m high. The tree is best maintained at roughly 2m high for easy maintenance and harvesting. </p>
<p>This plant can be grown year-round.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground. Because the plant eventually grows into a tree, it is easier to grow a few seedlings in separate pots before selecting the healthiest one to be grown in true ground.</p>

<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY cloche or netting. </p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Kedondong trees are steady growers but do benefit from being fed high potassium and phosphorus fertilisers to encourage flowering and thus fruiting. Regular pruning to promote airflow will keep the plant healthy and neat. </p>
<p>The tree will need to be around 4 years old before it starts producing fruit if grown from seed.</p>
<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Young leaves can be harvested at any time. </p>
<p>Unripe fruits are small, hard and green while ripe fruits will become yellow and more fibrous. Unripe fruits are sour, while ripe fruits are slightly sweeter. Both ripe and unripe fruits can be harvested for consumption. Ripe fruits will have a fibrous, inedible pit that will need to be removed.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>This tree is grown via seed, or via woody cuttings with rooting hormone. This tree can also be grafted. </p>
	<br>

	<h4>If your plant has little to no flowers, you try fertilising the plant with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.<p></p>
<p>Many plants require pollinators to help them fruit. Bees, butterflies, birds and even beetles transport pollen from one flower to another, pollinating your crops and increasing their fruit yield. Attract some pollinators to your garden by growing pollinator-attracting crops, or become a pollinator yourself by hand-pollinating your plants. </p>
<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies. </p>
<p>Whiteflies can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray. </p>
<p>Squirrels, birds and fruit bats may eat unripe or ripe fruit. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off.</p>
