<p>Laksa is an aromatic herb that is used to flavour soups and is the most important spice in its namesake dish. It is highly tolerant of heat and heavy rain, making it an easy herb for most gardeners to grow in Singapore. </p>
<p>Laksa plants are typically treated as annual crops as older plants tend to get leggy and untidy. However, they can also be kept as perennials if they are hard pruned regularly. </p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
<p>Laksa thrives in 4-6 hours of direct sunlight, but plants can also tolerate about 6-8 hours of indirect sunlight. Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 15cm deep, making them suitable for container planting and corridor gardening. These plants can tolerate waterlogging and can be planted in garden areas prone to ponding. Keep your plants cool with mulch and plenty of water to encourage growth.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Laksa plants grow rapidly, especially with regular harvesting and the use of high nitrogen fertilisers will encourage the plant to grow more leaves. Plants can be fertilised once every two weeks or after hard pruning. </p>
<p>Laksa plants will grow leggy and untidy as the plant gets older. Encourage new growth by regularly hard pruning the plant.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Young leaves can be harvested at any time. </p>
<p>Unripe fruits are small, hard and green while ripe fruits will become yellow and more fibrous. Unripe fruits are sour, while ripe fruits are slightly sweeter. Both ripe and unripe fruits can be harvested for consumption. Ripe fruits will have a fibrous, inedible pit that will need to be removed.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>This tree is grown via seed, or via woody cuttings with rooting hormone. This tree can also be grafted. </p>

	<h4>If your plant has little to no flowers, you try fertilising the plant with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.<p></p>
<p>Many plants require pollinators to help them fruit. Bees, butterflies, birds and even beetles transport pollen from one flower to another, pollinating your crops and increasing their fruit yield. Attract some pollinators to your garden by growing pollinator-attracting crops, or become a pollinator yourself by hand-pollinating your plants. </p>
<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies. </p>
<p>Whiteflies can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray. </p>
<p>Squirrels, birds and fruit bats may eat unripe or ripe fruit. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off.</p>
