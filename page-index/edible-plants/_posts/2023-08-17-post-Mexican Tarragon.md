  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4> 
		 <p> This plant thrives in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">6 or more hours of direct sunlight, or 6-8 hours of indirect sunlight</a>.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 15cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>.These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p> 
	<br>

<section> 
  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
		<p>Mexican Tarragon are rapid growers and benefit from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">regular hard pruning</a> to promote additional leaf growth. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">Fertilising</a> the plant with high nitrogen fertilisers after pruning will encourage the plant to bounce back.</p> 
	<br> 
</section> 
 
<section> 
  <h4>Harvesting:</h4> 
		<p>The plant can be harvested for young leaves via the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again/">cut-and-come-again-method</a> at any time.</p>

<section> 
  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
		<p>Mexican Tarragon are generally propagated via <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">stem cuttings</a> rooted in water or soil as the plant does not fruit readily in the tropics.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p> This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p>If your plant has few to no flowers, you can fertilise the plant with fertilisers high in phosphorus and potassium, which encourages root and flower growth.</p>
	<p>The plant tends to get leggy with age. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Prune</a> the plant down and fertilise with a <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">high nitrogen fertiliser</a> to encourage bushiness.</p>
		<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">Spider Mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
