	<p>Limau Purut fruit rinds and leaves are key ingredients in several Southeast Asian dishes, with the most famous being Thai Tom Yum. Unfortunately, the fruit itself is rather dry and produces very little pulp and juice.</p>
	<p>As a perennial tree, it is a common sight in edible gardens, permaculture gardens, and low maintenance beds.</p>
	<p>The plant is part of the citrus family, which also includes limes. All citrus plants are host plants for the lime butterfly and can be part of the planting palette for biodiversity-attracting gardens.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>This tree does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of direct sunlight. This plant can also grow in areas with 6 or more hours of indirect sunlight, but growth will be slow and the plant will produce less fruit.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 50cm deep, or in true ground. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe.</p>
	<p>This tree can grow up to 6m high, and usually has a broad crown. Many gardeners maintain this plant as a large bush, and regularly prune it down to around 1 or 1.5m for easy harvesting. 
This plant can be grown year-round.</p>

	<h4>Sowing Seeds</h4>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground. Because the plant eventually grows into a tree, it is easier to grow a few seedlings in separate pots before selecting the healthiest one to be grown in true ground.</p>

	<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by caterpillars, snails, or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY cloche or netting.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Limau Purut trees are steady growers and generally does not need fertilizing. Regular pruning to promote airflow will keep the plant healthy and neat.</p>
	<p>The tree will need to be around 5 years old before it starts producing fruit.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Leaves can be harvested at any time. Mature fruits are wrinkly and dark green, and can be harvested for juicing and for the rind. The tree produces fruit continuously throughout the year.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>This tree is grown via seed, or via woody cuttings with rooting hormone. This tree can also be grafted.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
	<p>Caterpillars, usually from the Lime Butterfly, can rapidly eat all the leaves of your plant. If your plant has lots of large holes and small brown or black faecal pellets scattered around damaged leaves, you likely have a caterpillar infestation. Manually remove the caterpillars by hand and protect your plants with netting.</p>
	<p>Whiteflies can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray.</p>
