	<p>Custard Apples are small trees with fragrant flowers and edible fruits. It is a popular tree to grow in many home and edible gardens as it can fruit even when kept at a small size and requires very little maintenance. The fruits are typically eaten raw or added to smoothies and desserts.</p>
	<p>As a perennial tree, it is a common sight in edible gardens, permaculture gardens, and low maintenance beds.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>This tree does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight. It can also grow in gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but the growth will be slow and the plant will have less fruits.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 50cm deep, or in true ground. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe. Root rot and poor drainage will also lead to a poor fruit yield. This tree is drought-tolerant.</p>
	<p>This tree can grow up to 15m high. The tree is best maintained at roughly 1-1.5m high for easy maintenance and harvesting.</p>
	<p>This plant can be grown year-round.</p>

	<h4>Sowing Seeds</h4>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground. Because the plant eventually grows into a tree, it is easier to grow a few seedlings in separate pots before selecting the healthiest one to be grown in true ground.</p>

	<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY cloche or netting.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Custard Apple trees are steady growers but do benefit from being fed high potassium and phosphorus fertilisers to encourage flowering and thus fruiting. Regular pruning to promote airflow will keep the plant healthy and neat. 
The tree will need to be around 3 years old before it starts producing fruit if grown from seed.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Fruits are considered ripe when they are slightly soft to the touch but are not mushy. Different varieties may also darken to dull green, yellow or purple. Fruits can be harvested unripe then left to ripen off the tree or harvested ripe for immediate consumption.</p>
	<p>Seeds are toxic when ingested and should be removed before serving.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>This tree is grown via seed, or via woody cuttings with rooting hormone. This tree can also be grafted.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>If your plant has little to no flowers, you try fertilising the plant with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the Many plants require pollinators to help them fruit. Bees, butterflies, birds and even beetles transport pollen from one flower to another, pollinating your crops and increasing their fruit yield. Attract some pollinators to your garden by growing pollinator-attracting crops or become a pollinator yourself by hand-pollinating your plants.</p>
	<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
	<p>Whiteflies can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray. 
Fruit flies can lay eggs in the fruit, resulting in larvae damaging the fruit and creating spots on the skin. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off.</p>
	<p>Squirrels, birds and fruit bats may eat unripe or ripe fruit. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off.</p>
