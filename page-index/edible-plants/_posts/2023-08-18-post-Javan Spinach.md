	<img title="Javan spinach plant. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/javanspinach%20(1)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>This plant needs <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">about 4-8 hours of direct sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">moist, well-drained soil</a> at least 10cm deep, making them suitable for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">container gardening</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe. Keep your plants cool with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">mulch</a> and plenty of water to encourage growth.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Waterleaf is a rapid grower and generally does not need fertiliser, but it can be fed with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">high nitrogen fertilisers</a> once a month to encourage leaf growth. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Regular pruning</a> will encourage additional growth and improve air circulation.</p>

They are typically harvested continuously via the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again/">cut-and-come-again method</a>.</p>
	<p>Seeds can be harvested for immediate planting when fruit pods are brown and dry.</p>
