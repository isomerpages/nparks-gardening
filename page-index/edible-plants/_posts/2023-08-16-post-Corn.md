	<p>Corn is a large and important grain that can create interest for large edible gardens. Because it is wind-pollinated, it is traditionally grown in large numbers close together so that wind-borne pollen can reach more ears on neighbouring plants. They can be grown in pots, but this is usually quite impractical as multiple corn plants are required for pollination. Most common corn varieties are yellow, but there are also cultivars with white, purple, or multi-coloured kernels. Immature and mature corn is versatile and can be eaten in a wide variety of ways. It is most commonly eaten raw, roasted, in soup, as a flour, or as a syrup.</p>
	<p>Corn can be planted with beans and squash as part of the Three Sisters method of companion planting. It benefits from being paired with a living mulch to keep the soil moist and cool.</p> 
	<p>Corn is an annual crop and will need to be cut down after it stops producing.</p>

  <h4>Environmental needs:</h4> 
	<p>This plant does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of 6-8 hours of direct sunlight. It can be grown in gardens with 6 or more hours of indirect sunlight, but the plants may grow slower and produce less fruits.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 20cm deep, or in true ground. These plants are vulnerable to heat stress and wilting, so keep your plants cool with mulch and plenty of water during dry and hot seasons to encourage growth.</p>

	<p>Corn is wind-pollinated and will need other corn plants nearby for pollination. Corn can be planted in squares of at least 9 plants to fertilise more ears. Corn can also be hand-pollinated for fuller ears. Regularly tapping the top or shaking the plant to shake pollen off its tassels onto the silks of unripe ears of corn also help with pollination.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4> 
		<p>Sow seeds individually in a seedling tray filled with potting mix or seedling mix. Lightly mist the soil until damp, once a day.</p>

		<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15-30cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. The seeds are vulnerable to being eaten by rodents and birds and should be protected with a DIY cloche or netting. Directly planting corn is preferable as it does not transplant well.</p>
	<p>Seeds should sprout in less than a week.</p>
	<br> 
</section> 
 
<section>
	<h4>Transplanting:</h4>
	<p>Seedlings will be ready for transplanting into pots or true ground when they have developed 4 or more leaves, or roughly a week or two after germination. Leave 15-30cm between each plant to encourage more growth and better ventilation.</p>
	<p>Take note that corn transplants are delicate and will need to be monitored. Water the transplants up to twice a day to encourage them to establish roots quicker and support the seedlings with stakes if they do not stabilise.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section> 
  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
		<p>Corn will produce more flowers and thus more fruit when fed with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. Plants can be fertilised regularly a month after germination for a fuller crop.</p>
	<p>It is a good practice to prune regularly and remove dead leaves and stems to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant. Regular pruning also decreases the likelihood of pests quickly taking over the plant.</p>
	<p>Most corn varieties are around 1.5-2m tall, but some cultivars can grow up to 4m tall and may be vulnerable to snapping if the stem is weak. Plants can be supported with stakes if they are in windy areas or exposed to turbulent weather.</p>

<section> 
  <h4>Harvesting:</h4> 
	<p>Plants can be harvested for leaves and stems at any size, with younger leaves being the most tender. Most gardeners will begin harvesting from Chinese Mustard around a month after sowing.</p>
	<p>The whole plant can be harvested once by cutting the entire plant above the roots, or multiple times by harvesting the older leaves as per the <a href="https://staging.dmhtu0pi4p9u7.amplifyapp.com/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again/">cut-and-come-again</a> method.</p>

  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
		<p>Chinese Mustard is grown from seeds.</p> 
	<br>

<section> 
  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>Leaf miners are fly larvae that eat the leaves from the inside, leaving white lines or patches in their wake. Manually remove damaged leaves and use fine mesh netting to stop the adult flies from laying eggs on the plant again.</p>
	<p>Etiolation is characterised by plants growing long and skinny, with weak stems and small leaves. The plants may also sometimes look yellowish. Plants etiolate when they do not get enough sunlight, which results in slow growth and untidy forms. To prevent this, grow plants in environments with enough light for them and make sure that each plant has enough space to prevent overcrowding.</p>
