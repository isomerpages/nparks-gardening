	<p>Corn is a large and important grain that can create interest for large edible gardens. Because it is wind-pollinated, it is traditionally grown in large numbers close together so that wind-borne pollen can reach more ears on neighbouring plants. They can be grown in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a>, but this is usually quite impractical as multiple corn plants are required for pollination. Most common corn varieties are yellow, but there are also <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#c">cultivars</a> with white, purple, or multi-coloured kernels. Immature and mature corn is versatile and can be eaten in a wide variety of ways. It is most commonly eaten raw, roasted, in soup, as a flour, or as a syrup.</p>
	<p>Corn is an <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#a">annual</a> crop and will need to be cut down after it stops producing.</p>

  <h4>Environmental needs:</h4> 
	<img title="Corn plants grown in close proximity to aid in pollination. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/corn_jacchua_3%20(2).jpg">
	<p>This plant does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">6-8 hours of direct sunlight</a>. It can be grown in gardens with 6 or more hours of indirect sunlight, but the plants may grow slower and produce less fruits.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 20cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to heat stress and wilting, so keep your plants cool with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/mulching/">mulch</a> and plenty of water during dry and hot seasons to encourage growth.</p>

	<p>Corn is wind-pollinated and will need other corn plants nearby for <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">pollination</a>. Corn can be planted in squares of at least 9 plants to fertilise more ears. Corn can also be hand-pollinated for fuller ears. Regularly tapping the top or shaking the plant to shake pollen off its tassels onto the silks of unripe ears of corn also help with pollination.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4> 
	<p>Sow seeds individually in a seedling tray filled with potting mix or seedling mix. Lightly mist the soil until damp, once a day.</p> 
	<iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7J87wY7U6s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>	<br>
		<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15-30cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. The seeds are vulnerable to being eaten by rodents and birds and should be protected with a <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches/">DIY cloche</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a>. Directly planting corn is preferable as it does not transplant well.</p>
	<p>Seeds should sprout in less than a week.</p>
	<br> 
</section> 
 
<section>
	<h4>Transplanting:</h4>
	<p>Seedlings will be ready for transplanting into pots or true ground when they have developed 4 or more leaves, or roughly a week or two after germination. Leave 15-30cm between each plant to encourage more growth and better ventilation.</p>
	<p>Take note that corn transplants are delicate and will need to be monitored. Water the transplants up to twice a day to encourage them to establish roots quicker and support the seedlings with <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/staking">stakes</a> if they do not stabilise.</p>
	<br>
</section>

<section> 
  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
	<p>Corn will produce more &lt; a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#f"&gt;flowers and thus more fruit when fed with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium</a>. Plants can be fertilised regularly a month after germination for a fuller crop.</p>
	<p>It is a good practice to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune regularly</a> and remove dead leaves and stems to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant. Regular pruning also decreases the likelihood of pests quickly taking over the plant.</p>
	<p>Most corn varieties are around 1.5-2m tall, but some cultivars can grow up to 4m tall and may be vulnerable to snapping if the stem is weak. Plants can be supported with <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/staking/">stakes</a> if they are in windy areas or exposed to turbulent weather.</p>

  <h4>Harvesting:</h4> 
	<img title="Mature corn with dry, brown tassels. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/Corn_JacChua.jpg">
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techiniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for ripe ears around three months after sowing. The best time to harvest the fruit is in the early morning, before 9am.</p>
	<p>Immature ears of corn can be harvested and eaten. Immature ears will have lush, green tassels.</p>
	<p>Mature ears of corn will have brown and dry tassels, and the kernels should be plump and full of liquid.</p>

  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
	<p>Corn is grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagation-by-seeds">seeds</a>.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
	<p>If your plant has little to no flowers, you try fertilising the plant with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium</a>. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>
	<img title="Unfertilised corn. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/corn_unfertilised_jacchua.jpg">
	<p>Ears of corn with “missing” kernels are not fully pollinated. Hand-pollinate your corn by shaking pollen directly onto the corn silks to encourage more kernels to form. Planting corn in dense blocks will increase the rate of <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">pollination</a> as pollen from nearby plants are more likely to land on corn silks.</p>
		<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">wilted from heat stress</a> or is overgrown. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests.</p>
	<p>Corn can become infested with beetle larvae that bore into the stem or fruits. Physically remove the grubs and affected plant parts and regularly check the plant for infestations.</p>
	<p>Birds and mice are attracted to ripe fruit and freshly planted seeds. Protect the plant with <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a>.</p>
