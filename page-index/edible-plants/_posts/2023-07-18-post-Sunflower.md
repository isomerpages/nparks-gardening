<p>Sunflowers are large iconic flowers that will make heads turn in any garden. Not only are they beautiful, but they are also useful bee-attracting plants, and have edible seeds and can also be eaten as microgreens! </p>
<p>There are a wide variety of cultivars, with mammoth varieties growing beyond 4m and deep red and multi-headed varieties to spice up your garden.</p>
<p>A large annual flower, this plant is suitable for perimeter planting, or as a feature plant. It also can be used in edible gardens, biodiversity-attracting gardens, and rooftop gardens. </p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
		<img style="height:390px; width:520px" src="/images/Horti%20techniques/ContainerPlanting_JacChua%20(3).jpg">
	
<p>Sunflowers grow best in 6-8 hours of direct sunlight. They can tolerate 4-5 hours of direct sunlight or at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but may have slower or stunted growth. Plants do best in well-draining sandy loam soils at least 20cm deep but are also highly tolerant of dry soils and drought-prone environments. Taller cultivars that grow to 3m or more will require at least 50cm of soil for stability. These plants are vulnerable to root rot, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of organic matter to let the roots breathe. </p>
<p>Keep your plants cool with mulch and plenty of water to encourage growth.</p>
<p>Taller sunflowers may need staking to prevent snapping. Areas prone to strong wind may damage the plant as it grows taller.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
<p>Sow seeds individually in a seedling tray filled with potting mix or seedling mix. Lightly mist the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 2 weeks.</p>

	<br>

<p>The seedlings will be vulnerable to high heat and heavy rain and are best kept in a sheltered propagation area or a shaded space with around 4 hours of partial or direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15-30cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 10 days.</p>

	<h4>Transplanting:</h4>
<p>Seedlings will be ready for transplanting into pots or true ground when they have developed 4 or more leaves, or roughly a week or two after germination. Leave 15-30cm between each plant to encourage more growth and better ventilation.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
<p>Cranberry Hibiscus will produce more flowers when fed with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium, and more leaves when fed with fertilisers high in Nitrogen. To encourage both leaves and flowers, the plants can be fed with balanced fertilisers.  Plants can be fertilised regularly a month after germination for a fuller crop. </p>
<p>It is a good practice to prune regularly and remove dead leaves and stems to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant. Regular pruning also decreases the likelihood of pests quickly taking over the plant. </p>
<p>This plant can grow more than 2m tall, but for the ease of harvesting it can be topped off at a manageable hight of around 1.5m.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Plants can be harvested for leaves and flowers at any time.  Fruits can be harvested for seeds when they are brown and dry.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Cranberry Hibiscus can be grown from seed, but they are usually propagated via stem cuttings rooted in soil.  </p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p>If your plant has little to no flowers, you try fertilising the plant with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth.</p>
<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies. </p>
