<p>Tapiocas are a common root vegetable that is extensively grown and consumed across Southeast Asia. The starchy roots are processed into a variety of snacks and desserts and is a key ingredient in bubble tea pearls. The leaves are often steamed and eaten as a vegetable.</p>
<p>A large perennial crop, Tapioca is often found in heritage gardens, permaculture gardens, rooftop gardens and edible gardens.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
<p>Tapioca is a hardy crop that can grows well in well in 4-6 hours of direct sunlight or at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight. Plants do best in well-draining sandy loam soils at least 30cm deep but are also highly tolerant of dry soils and drought-prone environments. To optimise tuber growth, add plenty of organic matter to the soil to encourage root and stem growth.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Tapioca is a rapid grower and generally does not need fertilizing. Plants can grow up to 4m high with enough sunlight, and is prone to snapping. Prune the plant to around 1.5m for ease of maintenance.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>The plant can be harvested for the tuber around a year after planting. Harvesting the tubers after may result in them being very fibrous and hard root that is unpleasant to eat.
Plants can be harvested for leaves at any time, with younger leaves being the most tender. Young leaves can be harvested multiple times via the cut-and-come-again method. </p>
<p>The whole plant can be harvested once by digging up the fleshy root with a spade. </p>
	<p>All plants parts must be thoroughly cooked as the tuber and the leaves contain toxins. </p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Tapiocas are primarily grown from woody stem cuttings rooted directly into soil or division of the tubers. </p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
<p>This plant is prone to rust during the wet season. Prune the plant regularly to increase airflow, and remove heavily affected leaves. </p>
