	<p>Tapiocas are a common root vegetable that is extensively grown and consumed across Southeast Asia. The <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#t">tubers</a> are processed into a variety of snacks and desserts and is a key ingredient in bubble tea pearls. The leaves are often steamed and eaten as a vegetable.</p>
	<p>A large <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop, Tapioca is often found in heritage gardens, rooftop gardens and edible gardens.</p>

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
	<p>Tapioca is a hardy crop that can grows well in well in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-6 hours of direct sunlight or at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight</a>.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">sandy soil</a> at least 30cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. They are also highly tolerant of dry soils and drought-prone environments. To optimise tuber growth, add plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">inorganic soil amendments</a> to the soil to encourage root and stem growth.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Tapioca is a rapid grower and generally does not need fertilizing. Plants can grow up to 4m high with enough sunlight, and is prone to snapping. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Prune</a> the plant to around 1.5m for ease of maintenance. Older leaves and side branches should be regularly pruned to force the plant to focus its energy on growing tubers.</p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<img title="Tapioca tubers on sale at a wet market. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/tapioca_root_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>The plant can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for the tuber around a year after planting. Harvesting the tubers after may result in them being very fibrous and hard root that is unpleasant to eat.</p>
	<p>Plants can be harvested for leaves at any time, with younger leaves being the most tender. Young leaves can be harvested multiple times via the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again">cut-and-come-again method</a>. </p>
	<p>The whole plant can be harvested once by digging up the tubers with a spade. </p>
	<p><b>All plants parts must be thoroughly cooked as the tuber and the leaves contain toxins.</b> </p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Tapiocas are primarily grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">woody stem cuttings</a> rooted directly into soil or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">division of the tubers</a>. </p>
	<br>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
		<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">Spider Mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a> or is <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogged</a>. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests.</p>
<p>This plant is prone to rust during the wet season. Prune the plant regularly to increase airflow, and remove heavily affected leaves. </p>
