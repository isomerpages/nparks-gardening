	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
<p>Tapioca is a hardy crop that can grows well in well in 4-6 hours of direct sunlight or at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight. Plants do best in well-draining sandy loam soils at least 30cm deep but are also highly tolerant of dry soils and drought-prone environments. To optimise tuber growth, add plenty of organic matter to the soil to encourage root and stem growth.</p>

<p>Like most strong-smelling herbs, this plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p><p>
</p><p>Wilting leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, or move it to a shadier part of the garden.</p>
