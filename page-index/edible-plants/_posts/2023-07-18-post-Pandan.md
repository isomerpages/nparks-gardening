<p>Pandan is a common herb grown in a wide variety of gardens across Singapore. Its fragrant leaves produce a juice that is used to flavour desserts, tea, meat dishes, and rice. The leaf itself cannot be eaten because it is too fibrous and is typically discarded after cooking.</p>
<p>Pandan is a perennial crop that readily grows in most gardens with semi-shade and thrives in waterlogged areas. It has a relatively shallow root and can be grown in pots.</p>
<p>Because Pandan is hardy and grows rapidly, it can be used in gardens with clayey, waterlogged soils or used as a groundcover for low maintenance beds.</p>

  <h4>Environmental needs:</h4> 
  <img src=""> 
 <p> Pandan does well in less than 4 hours of direct sunlight or 6-8 hours of indirect sunlight. Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 10cm deep, making them suitable for container gardening. Pandan will also readily grow in heavy clay soil, along large waterbodies, and in heavily waterlogged areas.</p>
<p>Pandan can withstand periods of drought, but the lack of water will stunt its growth.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
<p>Pandan grows rapidly and are particularly fast growers during the wet season. If planted in true ground near other plants, Pandan can smother its neighbours if it is not hard pruned regularly.</p>

  <h4>Harvesting:</h4> 
<p>Plants can be harvested for leaves at any time. Older Leaves should be harvested from the bottom of the plant, as per cut-and-come-again harvesting, with new leaves left intact to ensure more growth.</p>
<p>Take note that the leaves have sharp edges and may cause skin irritation and cuts. Use arm sleeves and gloves when maintaining this plant for safety.</p>

  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
<p>Pandan is typically propagated by division. Offshoots can be readily taken for propagation once they have roots and can be cut at the base or twisted off the main plant.</p>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
  <p> Like most strong-smelling herbs, this plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites can the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies.</p>
<p>This plant can grow long and leggy, especially if it has been harvested from for a long time. Prop the top up with stakes or remove the leggy stem to allow offshoots to replace it.</p>
