	<p>Pandan is a common herb grown in a wide variety of gardens across Singapore. Its fragrant leaves produce a juice that is used to flavour desserts, tea, meat dishes, and rice. The leaf itself cannot be eaten because it is too fibrous and is typically discarded after cooking.</p>
	<p>Pandan is a <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop that readily grows in most gardens with semi-shade and thrives in <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogged</a> areas. It has a relatively shallow root and can be grown in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a>, but it is usually grown in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a> where it spreads rapidly.</p>
	<br>

  <h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4> 
		 <p> Pandan does well in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">less than 4 hours of direct sunlight or 6-8 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 10cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. Pandan will also readily grow in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">clayey soil</a>, along large waterbodies, and in heavily <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogged</a> areas.</p>
		<p>Pandan can withstand periods of drought, but the lack of water will stunt its growth.</p>

<section> 
  <h4>Growing:</h4> 
		<p>Pandan grows rapidly, particularly during the wet season. If planted in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground">true ground</a> near other plants, Pandan can smother its neighbours if it is not <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">hard pruned</a> regularly.</p> 
	<br>

<section> 
  <h4>Harvesting:</h4> 
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene">harvested</a> for leaves at any time. Older Leaves should be harvested from the bottom of the plant, as per <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again">cut-and-come-again harvesting</a>, with new leaves left intact to ensure more growth.</p>

<p>Whole heads of pandan can also be harvested, but the offshoots that develop will take a while to grow large enough to replace the harvested portion. </p>
	<p><b>Take note that the older leaves have sharp edges and may cause skin irritation and cuts</b>. Use arm sleeves and gloves when maintaining this plant for safety.</p> 
	<br>

  <h4>Propagation:</h4> 
		<img title="Young Pandan offshoots with plenty of roots. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/pandan_suckers%20(2)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>Pandan is typically <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division">propagated by division</a>. Offshoots can be readily taken for propagation once they have roots and can be cut at the base or twisted off the main plant.</p> 
	<br>

  <h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4> 
		<p> Like most strong-smelling herbs, this plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
		<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">Spider Mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like being root-bound. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
		<p>This plant can grow long and leggy, especially if it has been harvested from for a long time. Prop the top up with <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/staking/">stakes</a> or remove the leggy stem to allow offshoots to replace it.</p>
