<p>Cucumbers are a classic fruit eaten raw, in stews or preserved. They come in many cultivars with oblong fruits that range from small and green to large and yellow. Most varieties, particularly the ones eaten raw for salads, should be harvested when they are immature and not bitter .</p>
<p>An annual crop, these plants are often grown in rotation with other fruiting climbers. </p>
<p>This plant is part of the Cucurbita or Melon family, which includes other popular edible fruits like Bitter Gourd, Winter melon, and Pumpkin.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
<p>This vine does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of direct sunlight. This plant can also grow with 4-5 hours of direct sunlight and at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but will produce less fruits.</p>
<p>Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 30cm deep, or in true ground. The plant can be grown in smaller pots about 20cm deep, but growth will be slower due to the lack of water retention in less soil and a smaller root ball. </p>
<p>This vine is vulnerable to heat stress during the dry season. Water it regularly and mulch the base to prevent water loss. </p>
<p>As a fast-growing vine, this plant needs a sturdy trellis to scramble on. Because the fruits hang down, it is ideal for arch-shaped trellises.</p>

<p>As with all members of the melon family, this plant is bee pollinated and produces male and female flowers. To encourage the formation of more fruits, it is best to have at least 3 separate plants growing in the same area to have both male and female flowers available, and to have bee-attracting plants within the garden to encourage pollination. If your garden lacks bees, the plant can also be hand pollinated.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15-30cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within two weeks.</p>

<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY cloche or netting.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
<p>Cucumbers will produce more flowers and thus more fruit when fed with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. Plants can be fertilised regularly a month after germination for a fuller crop. </p>
<p>Because the vines will grow on top of each other, it is a good practice to prune regularly and remove dead leaves and vines to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant. </p>
<p>Young fruits have prickly hairs or small spines which can irritate the skin. Use gloves when handling the plant for safety.
Direct sunlight can damage the fruit. Allow leaves to grow over the fruit or protect it using a cloth cover. 
Allowing the fruit to sit in water can cause rotting. Keep the underside dry by placing it on a platform if the fruit is growing on the ground.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Plants can be harvested for fruits around three months after sowing. The best time to harvest the fruit is in the early morning, before 9am. </p>
<p>Cucumbers meant to be eaten raw are best harvested when immature. Immature fruits are dark green and are best harvested after most of the spines have smoothened out. Take note that some cucumber varieties (like Japanese Cucumbers) never truly lose their spines and need to be smoothened out or peeled to be safely eaten.</p>
<p>Ripe fruits are yellowish or fully yellow and tend to be bitter. Some varieties, like the Old Cucumber used for soups, are harvested ripe.</p>
<p>Regularly harvest the mature and immature fruit to encourage the plant to keep producing. </p>
<p>The plant will continuously produce fruit for about 6 months to a year before declining.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>This vine can be grown via seeds. Seeds can be taken from mature fruit for immediate planting. </p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p>If your vine has little to no flowers, you try fertilising the plant with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>
<p>However, if your plant is producing lots of flowers but is not bearing fruit, you may not have female and male flowers present in the same area together. Pollen from the male flower needs to be transferred to the female flower before the female flower can become a fruit. This process is called pollination and is important or the formation of many edible fruits. Vines from the melon family generally produce male flowers before female flowers. Having at least 3 plants of varying ages in the garden will make both male and female flowers present for pollination to happen. </p>
<p>Many plants require pollinators to help them fruit. Bees, butterflies, birds and even beetles transport pollen from one flower to another, pollinating your crops and increasing their fruit yield. Attract some pollinators to your garden by growing pollinator-attracting crops, or become a pollinator yourself by hand-pollinating your plants. </p>
<p>Bitter immature cucumbers are usually formed when the plant is under a lot of heat stress. Mulch the plant and water it more regularly to encourage it to produce less bitter fruit. 
Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies. </p>
<p>Whiteflies can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray. 
Fruit flies can lay eggs in the fruit, resulting in larvae damaging the fruit and creating spots on the skin. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off. </p>
<p>This plant is prone to mildew during the wet season. Prune the plant regularly to increase airflow, and remove heavily affected leaves. </p>
<p>Wilting leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss. </p>
