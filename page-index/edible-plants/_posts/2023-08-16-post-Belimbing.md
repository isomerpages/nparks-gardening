	<p>Belimbing trees are small fruit trees that produce numerous small, oblong green fruits that are very sour. The fruits can be eaten raw as a relish, stewed with chilli, or blended into sauces. Its numerous <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#f/">flowers</a> are very attractive to bees and butterflies.</p>
	<p>As a <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p/">perennial</a> tree, it is a common sight in edible gardens, permaculture gardens, and low maintenance beds.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>This tree does best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight</a>.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">moist, well-drained soil</a> at least 50cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>
	<p>This tree can grow up to 10m high, but because the fruits form along the stem, it is best to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune</a> it down to around 2 or 3m for easy harvesting.</p>
 <p>This plant can be grown year-round.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Sowing Seeds</h4>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground. Because the plant eventually grows into a tree, it is easier to grow a few seedlings in separate pots before selecting the healthiest one to be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">grown in true ground</a>.</p>

	<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches/">cloche</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a>.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Belimbing trees are steady growers and generally does not need fertilising. The tree can grow up to 10m high but because the fruits form along the stems and trunk, it is best to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune</a> it down to around 1.5-3m for easy harvesting. Regular pruning to promote airflow will keep the plant healthy and neat.</p>
	<p>The tree will need to be around 4 years old before it starts producing fruit.</p>
<br>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Immature green fruits and mature white fruits can both be<a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/"> harvested</a> for consumption, although most dishes use the immature green fruit. The tree produces fruit continuously throughout the year.</p>
	<p>The fruits have a very delicate and thin skin and requires hand-picking. They will rot 4-5 days after harvest and are therefore usually eaten immediately or pickled.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>This tree is grown <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seeds/">via seed</a>.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">mealy bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">Prune off</a> the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, lack of sunlight, and <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiencies/">nutrient deficiencies</a>.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a> can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray.</p>
