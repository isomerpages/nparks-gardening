	<p>Belimbing trees are small fruit trees that produce numerous small, oblong green fruits that are very sour. The fruits can be eaten raw as a relish, stewed with chilli, or blended into sauces. Its numerous flowers are very attractive to bees and butterflies.</p>
	<p>As a <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> tree, it is a common sight in edible gardens.</p>

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
	<img title="A belimbling tree growing new leaves. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/belimbling%20(1)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>This tree does best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight</a>.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 1m deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>. These plants are vulnerable to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">root rot</a>, so ensure that your pots drain well, and that your soil has plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to let the roots breathe.</p>
	<p>This tree can grow up to 10m high, but because the fruits form along the stem, it is best to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune</a> it down to around 2 or 3m for easy harvesting.</p>

	<h4>Sowing Seeds</h4>

	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground. Because the plant eventually grows into a tree, it is easier to grow a few seedlings in separate pots before selecting the healthiest one to be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">grown in true ground</a>.</p>
	<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches/">cloche</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a>.</p>

  <h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Belimbing trees are steady growers and generally does not need fertilising. The tree can grow up to 10m high but because the fruits form along the stems and trunk, it is best to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">prune</a> it down to around 1.5-3m for easy harvesting. Regular pruning to promote airflow will keep the plant healthy and neat.</p>
	<p>The tree will need to be around 4 years old before it starts producing fruit.</p>
<br>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Immature green fruits and mature white fruits can both be<a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/"> harvested</a> for consumption, although most dishes use the immature green fruit. The tree produces fruit continuously throughout the year.</p>
	<p>The fruits have a very delicate and thin skin and requires hand-picking. They will rot 4-5 days after harvest and are therefore usually eaten immediately or pickled.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>This tree is grown <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seeds/">via seed</a>.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>If your plant has few to no flowers, you can fertilise the plant with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers high in phosphorus and potassium</a>. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>
		<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">spider mites</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like root rot. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
