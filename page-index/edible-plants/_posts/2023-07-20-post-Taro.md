	<p>Taro is a common crop with a large edible swollen stem often called <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#t">tubers</a>, which are processed into chips, flour, paste and flavouring. The young leaves can also be cooked and eaten as a vegetable.</p>
	<p>It is a versatile <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop that is used extensively in edible gardens to break up <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">clayey soil</a> or to fill <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogged</a> areas of a garden.</p>
	<p>Taro is part of the Araceae or Aroid family, which includes other edible plants like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/elephant-foot-yam/">Elephant Foot Yam</a>. Many ornamental members of the family are very popular as houseplants, including <a href="/page-index/ornamental-plants/adansons-monstera/">Monsteras</a> and <a href="/page-index/ornamental-plants/devils-ivy/">Devil’s Ivy</a>. </p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<p>Taro grows well in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4-6 hours of direct sunlight or 6-8 hours of indirect sunlight</a>. Plants do best in <a href="page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 30cm deep, but are also highly tolerant of <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogged</a> and flooded environments. To optimise tuber growth, add plenty of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">organic matter</a> to the soil to encourage root and stem growth. </p>
	<p>This plant will not do well in hot, exposed places like on rooftop gardens, and will be prone to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">wilting from heat stress</a>.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Taro grows rapidly in the rainy season and has the potential to overwhelm neighbouring plants. Its large size and rapid growth make it a good filler plant for parts of the garden with <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogged soil</a> or that are prone to flooding. Grow Taro in its own garden bed or in a designated area for ease of maintenance. </p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<img title="Taro tubers on sale at a wet market. Photo by Flora and Fauna Web." src="/images/Plants/taro(2)_ffw.jfif">
	<p>Plants can be harvested for tubers and young leaflets at any time but will need at least 4 to 10 months to produce additional tubers after being planted.  The tubers are typically harvested via <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">division</a>, while young leaves are harvested via the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cut-and-come-again/">cut-and-come-again method</a>.</p>
	<p><b>The tubers and leaves should not be eaten raw as they contain calcium oxalate, which is toxic.</b> The calcium oxalate is destroyed by cooking with heat.</p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Taro is propagated via <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-division/">division</a> of the tubers. </p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>This plant is relatively resistant to pests and disease if kept healthy.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss.</p>
