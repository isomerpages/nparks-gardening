<p>Brinjals are one of the most common crops you see in Community Gardens in Singapore as they can grow quickly into productive bushes and are relatively pest resistant. With a wide variety of cultivars, brinjals come in colours ranging from dark purple to white and even yellow, and can be round, egg-shaped, or oblong. The fruits are eaten while they are immature, and can be roasted, stewed, or made into sauces.</p>
<p>A perennial crop, these plants are a popular mainstay in edible gardens of all sizes. Eggplants in true ground can produce fruit for a few years, while those in pots and can produce fruit for more than a year if cared for properly.</p>
<p>This plant is part of the Solanum or Nightshade family, which includes other popular edible fruits like Tomatoes and Chillies.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
		<img src="/images/Plants/Brinjal_JacChua%20(1).jpg">
<p>This vine does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of direct sunlight. This plant can also grow with 4-5 hours of direct sunlight and at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but will produce less fruits.</p>
<p>Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 15cm deep, or in true ground.</p>

<p>As with all members of the Nightshade family, this plant is buzz pollinated and produces the most fruit when bees are around to pollinate it. Growing more bee-attracting plants within the garden will encourage pollination. It can be hand-pollinated, but the success rate is generally lower. </p>
<p>These plants can get blossom end rot, which shows up as dark, sunken blotches at the end of fruits. It is a symptom of a lack of calcium reaching the fruit, which is usually caused by a lack of water or inconsistent watering. Keep your soil moist but not waterlogged and take care to water more often during the dry season.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15-30cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within two weeks. </p>

<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY cloche or netting.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
<p>Brinjals will produce more flowers and thus more fruit when fed with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. Plants can be fertilised regularly a month after germination for a fuller crop. </p>
<p>This plant grows as a small shrub, producing large leaves on a few branches. It is a good practice to prune regularly and remove dead leaves to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant. </p>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Plants can be harvested for fruits around 3 months after sowing. The best time to harvest the fruit is in the early morning, before 9am.</p>
<p>Eggplants are generally eaten when they are immature. Immature fruits should be picked when they are glossy, and have a soft, spongy texture.</p>
<p>Ripe fruits are usually a dull brown or yellow, and will rapidly become soft and wrinkly. Ripe fruit should not be eaten, but can be harvested for seeds to be used for immediate planting. </p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Lettuce is primarily grown from seeds. </p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p>Caterpillars, usually from the Diamondback moth and Tussock moth, can rapidly eat all the leaves of your plant. If your plant has lots of large holes and small brown or black poo pellets scattered around damaged leaves, you likely have a caterpillar infestation. Manually remove the caterpillars by hand and protect your plants with netting.</p>
<p>Leaf miners are fly larvae that eat the leaves from the inside, leaving white lines or patches in their wake. Manually remove damaged leaves and use fine mesh netting to stop the adult flies from laying eggs on the plant again.</p>
<p>Etiolation is characterised by plants growing long and skinny, with weak stems and small leaves. The plants may also sometimes look yellowish. Plants etiolate when they do not get enough sunlight, which results in slow growth and untidy forms. To prevent this, grow plants in environments with enough light for them and make sure that each plant has enough space to prevent overcrowding.</p>
