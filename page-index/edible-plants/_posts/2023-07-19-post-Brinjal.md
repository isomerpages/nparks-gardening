	<p>Brinjals are one of the most common crops you see in Community Gardens in Singapore as they can grow quickly into productive bushes and are relatively pest resistant. With a wide variety of cultivars, brinjals come in colours ranging from dark purple to white and even yellow, and can be round, egg-shaped, or oblong. The fruits are eaten while they are immature, and can be roasted, stewed, or made into sauces.</p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop, these plants are a popular mainstay in edible gardens of all sizes. Eggplants in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a> can produce fruit for a few years, while those in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> and can produce fruit for more than a year if cared for properly.</p>
	<p>This plant is part of the Solanum or Nightshade family, which includes other popular edible fruits like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/tomato/">Tomatoes</a> and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/chilli/">Chillies</a>.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
	<img title="Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/Brinjal_JacChua%20(1).jpg">
	<p>This vine does best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light">full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of direct sunlight</a>. This plant can also grow with 4-5 hours of direct sunlight and at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but will produce less fruits.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 15cm deep, or in t<a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>.</p>

	<p>As with all members of the Nightshade family, this plant is buzz pollinated and produces the most fruit when bees are around to pollinate it. Growing more <a href="/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants">bee-attracting plants</a> within the garden will encourage pollination. </p>
	<p>These plants can get <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiencies/">blossom end rot</a>, which shows up as dark, sunken blotches at the end of fruits. It is a symptom of a lack of calcium reaching the fruit, which is usually caused by a <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering/">lack of water or inconsistent watering</a>. Keep your soil moist but not <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogged</a>and take care to water more often during the dry season.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
	<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15-30cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within two weeks. </p>

	<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches">cloche</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting">netting</a>.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
	<p>Brinjals will produce more flowers and thus more fruit when fed with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising">fertilised</a> regularly a month after germination for a fuller crop.</p>
	<p>This plant grows as a small shrub, producing large leaves on a few branches. It is a good practice to prune regularly and remove dead leaves to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant. </p>
	<br>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<p>Plants can be harvested for fruits around 3 months after sowing. The best time to harvest the fruit is in the early morning, before 9am.</p>
	<p>Eggplants are generally eaten when they are immature. Immature fruits should be picked when they are glossy, and have a soft, spongy texture.</p>
	<p>Ripe fruits are usually a dull brown or yellow, and will rapidly become soft and wrinkly. Ripe fruit should not be eaten, but can be harvested for seeds to be used for immediate planting. </p>

	<p>Brinjal are grown from <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed">seed</a>.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<p>If your plant has little to no flowers, you try fertilising the plant with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium</a>. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>
<p>Many plants require <a href="/page-index/biodiversity/pollinators/">pollinators</a> to help them fruit. Bees, butterflies, birds and even beetles transport pollen from one flower to another, pollinating your crops and increasing their fruit yield. Attract some pollinators to your garden by growing <a href="/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants/">pollinator-attracting plants</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/page-index/pests/ahpids">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs">mealy bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/scale-insects/">scale insects</a> often infest the plant if it is <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogged</a>, <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting/">wilted from heat stress</a>, or is <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering/">inconsistently watered</a>. <a href="/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests.</p><p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss. </p>
	<p>These plants can get <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiencies/">blossom end rot</a>, which shows up as dark, sunken blotches at the end of fruits. It is a symptom of a lack of calcium reaching the fruit, which is usually caused by a lack of water or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering/">inconsistent watering</a>. Keep your soil moist but not waterlogged and take care to water more often during the dry season.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/oriental-fruit-flies/">Fruit flies</a> can lay eggs in the fruit, resulting in larvae damaging the fruit and creating spots on the skin. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off. </p>
