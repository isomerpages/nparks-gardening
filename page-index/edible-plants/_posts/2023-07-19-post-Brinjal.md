	<p>Brinjals are one of the most common crops you see in Community Gardens in Singapore as they can grow quickly into productive bushes and are relatively pest resistant. With a wide variety of cultivars, brinjals come in colours ranging from dark purple to white, and can be round, egg-shaped, or oblong. The fruits are eaten while they are immature, and can be roasted, stewed, or made into sauces.</p>
	<p>A <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#p">perennial</a> crop, these plants are a popular mainstay in edible gardens of all sizes. Eggplants in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a> can produce fruit for a few years, while those in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> and can produce fruit for more than a year if cared for properly.</p>
	<p>This plant is part of the Solanum or Nightshade family, which includes other popular edible fruits like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/tomato/">Tomatoes</a> and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/chilli/">Chillies</a>.</p>

	<h4>Sun and soil needs:</h4>
	<img title="Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/Brinjal_JacChua%20(1).jpg">
	<p>This plant does best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light">full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of direct sunlight</a>. This plant can also grow with 4-5 hours of direct sunlight and at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but will produce less fruits.</p>
	<p>Plants do best in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a> with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">loamy soil</a> at least 15cm deep, or in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
	<p><a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed">Seeds can be sown directly</a> into pots or the ground around 15-30cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within two weeks. </p>

	<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches">cloche</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting">netting</a>.</p>

	<h4>Growing:</h4>
		<iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eGBg_S8yj0U" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>	<br>
	<p>Brinjals will produce more flowers and thus more fruit when fed with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising">fertilised</a> once a month after the plant produces its first flower for a fuller crop.</p>
		<p>As with all members of the Nightshade family, this plant is buzz-pollinated and produces the most fruit when <a href="/page-index/biodiversity/pollinators/">bees</a> are around to pollinate it. Growing more <a href="/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants/">bee-attracting plants</a> within the garden will encourage pollination.  </p>
	<p>This plant grows as a small shrub, producing large leaves on a few branches. It is a good practice to prune regularly and remove dead leaves to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant. </p>

	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
	<img title="Community Gardeners with greshly harvested Brinjal fruits. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Gardeners/Harvesting%20(5).jpg">
	<p>Plants can be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/harvesting-hygiene/">harvested</a> for fruits around 3 months after sowing. The best time to harvest the fruit is in the early morning, before 9am.</p>
	<p>Eggplants are generally eaten when they are immature. Immature fruits should be picked when they are glossy, and have a soft, spongy texture.</p>
	<img title="A mature eggplant that can be harvested for seeds, but is too bitter to be eaten. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Plants/eggplantmature_jacquelinechua.jpg">
	<p>Ripe fruits are usually a dull brown or yellow, and will rapidly become soft and wrinkly. Ripe fruit should not be eaten, but can be harvested for seeds to be used for immediate planting. </p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
	<img title="A brinjal fruit attacked by fruit flies. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Biodiversity/eggplant_fruitfly_jacquelinechua.jpg">
<p>If your plant has few to no flowers, you can fertilise the plant with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilisers high in phosphorus and potassium</a>. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>
	<p>As with all members of the Nightshade family, this plant is buzz-pollinated and produces the most fruit when <a href="/page-index/biodiversity/pollinators/">bees</a> are around to pollinate it. Growing more <a href="/page-index/glossary/biodiversity-attracting-plants/">bee-attracting plants</a> within the garden will encourage pollination.  </p>
<p><a href="/page-index/pests/aphids">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs">Mealy Bugs</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/scale-insects/">Scale Insects</a> often infest the plant if it has <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/plant-problems/">underlying problems</a> like repeated wilting from heat stress. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">Mechanical pest control</a> methods like <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pruning/">pruning</a> the infested parts are the best methods for managing these pests in the short term, but resolving the underlying problem will prevent them in the long term.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/plant-problems/wilting">Wilting</a> leaves during hot weather is a sign of heat stress. Increase the number of times the plant is watered daily, and apply mulch at the base to prevent water loss. </p>
	<p>These plants can get <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiencies/">blossom end rot</a>, which shows up as dark, sunken blotches at the end of fruits. It is a symptom of a lack of calcium reaching the fruit, which is usually caused by a lack of water or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering/">inconsistent watering</a>. Keep your soil moist but not waterlogged and take care to water more often during the dry season.</p>
	<p><a href="/page-index/pests/oriental-fruit-flies/">Fruit flies</a> can lay eggs in the fruit, resulting in larvae damaging the fruit and creating spots on the skin. Wrap your fruit in <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a> when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off. </p>
