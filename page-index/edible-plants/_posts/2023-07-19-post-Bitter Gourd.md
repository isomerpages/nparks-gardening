	<h3>Bitter Gourd (<em>Momordica charantia</em>)</h3>

<p>Bitter Gourd, as the name implies, is a bitter fruit used in a variety of Asian dishes. Eaten as an immature fruit, it can be stewed, fried, steamed or juiced. </p>
<p>The fruit has a lumpy appearance, with Chinese cultivars looking more warty and Indian varieties sporting spikes. The immature fruit ranges from bright green to white depending on cultivar, and the ripe fruit turns orange with bright red seeds.
	An annual crop, these plants are often grown in rotation with other fruiting climbers.</p>
<p>This plant is part of the Cucurbita or Melon family, which includes other popular edible fruits like Cucumber, Winter melon, and Pumpkin.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
		<img src="/images/Plants/Bittergourd%20(4).jpg">
<p>This vine does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of direct sunlight. This plant can also grow with 4-5 hours of direct sunlight and at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight but will produce less fruits.</p>
<p>Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 30cm deep, or in true ground. The plant can be grown in smaller pots about 20cm deep, but growth will be slower due to the lack of water retention in less soil and a smaller root ball. </p>
<p>As a fast-growing vine, this plant needs a sturdy trellis to scramble on. Because the fruits hang down, it is ideal for arch-shaped trellises.</p>

<p>Depending on the cultivar, tomatoes can grow as a vine (indeterminate) or as a small shrub (determinate). Vining varieties will need stakes or a trellis to support their growth.</p>
<p>As with all members of the melon family, this plant is bee-pollinated and produces male and female flowers. To encourage the formation of more fruits, it is best to have at least 3 separate plants growing in the same area to have both male and female flowers available, and to have bee-attracting plants within the garden to encourage pollination. If your garden lacks bees, the plant can also be hand pollinated.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
<p>Seeds can be sown directly into pots or the ground around 15-30cm apart. Lightly water the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within 2 weeks.</p>

<p>The seedlings are generally resilient to most environmental factors but may be vulnerable to being eaten by snails or birds. Protect your young plants with a DIY cloche or netting.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
<p>Bitter gourds will produce more flowers and thus more fruit when fed with fertilisers high in phosphorus and potassium. Plants can be fertilised regularly a month after germination for a fuller crop.</p>
<p>Because the vines will grow on top of each other, it is a good practice to prune regularly and remove dead leaves and vines to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant.</p>
<p>Direct sunlight can damage the fruit. Allow leaves to grow over the fruit or protect it using a cloth cover.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Plants can be harvested for immature fruits around 4 months after sowing. The best time to harvest the fruit is in the early morning, before 9am.</p>
<p>The plant will continuously produce fruit for about 6 months to a year before declining. </p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>

<p>This vine can be grown via seeds. Seeds can be taken from mature fruit for immediate planting.</p>

	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p>If your vine has little to no flowers, you try fertilising the plant with fertilisers high in phosphorus and potassium. These nutrients encourage root and flower growth, which are important for the plant to produce more fruit.</p>
<p>However, if your plant is producing lots of flowers but is not bearing fruit, you may not have female and male flowers present in the same area together. Pollen from the male flower needs to be transferred to the female flower before the female flower can become a fruit. This process is called pollination and is important or the formation of many edible fruits. Vines from the melon family generally produce male flowers before female flowers. Having at least 3 plants of varying ages in the garden will make both male and female flowers present for pollination to happen. </p>
<p>Many plants require pollinators to help them fruit. Bees, butterflies, birds and even beetles transport pollen from one flower to another, pollinating your crops and increasing their fruit yield. Attract some pollinators to your garden by growing pollinator-attracting crops, or become a pollinator yourself by hand-pollinating your plants. </p>
<p>Aphids, mealy bugs, and spider mites often infest the plant if it is sickly or overgrown. Prune off the infested parts, or apply horticultural oils like neem oil and white summer oil to suffocate the remaining pests. Regularly prune the plant to allow light and air to reach throughout the plant, and check the plant for underlying problems like root rot, lack of sunlight, and nutrient deficiencies. </p>
<p>Whiteflies can infest the plant and lay eggs under its leaves. Remove affected plant parts and catch remaining adults with yellow sticky paper or treat them with citrus spray. 
Fruit flies can lay eggs in the fruit, resulting in larvae damaging the fruit and creating spots on the skin. Wrap your fruit in netting when it starts to develop from a fertilised flower, ideally after all the petals have dropped off. </p>
<p>All vines from the melon family tend to attract beetles, which typically attack the plant’s leaves at night. They don’t harm the fruit, but if too many leaves are eaten, the plant may slow its growth.  </p>
