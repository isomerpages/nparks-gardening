<p>Cucumbers are a classic fruit eaten raw, in stews or preserved. They come in many cultivars with oblong fruits that range from small and green to large and yellow. Most varieties, particularly the ones eaten raw for salads, should be harvested when they are immature and not bitter .</p>
<p>An annual crop, these plants are often grown in rotation with other fruiting climbers. </p>
<p>This plant is part of the Cucurbita or Melon family, which includes other popular edible fruits like Bitter Gourd, Winter melon, and Pumpkin.</p>

	<h4>Environmental needs:</h4>
<p>This vine does best in full sun gardens with a minimum of 6 hours of direct sunlight. This plant can also grow with 4-5 hours of direct sunlight and at least 6 hours of indirect sunlight, but will produce less fruits.</p>
<p>Plants do best in moist, well-drained soil at least 30cm deep, or in true ground. The plant can be grown in smaller pots about 20cm deep, but growth will be slower due to the lack of water retention in less soil and a smaller root ball. </p>
<p>This vine is vulnerable to heat stress during the dry season. Water it regularly and mulch the base to prevent water loss. </p>
<p>As a fast-growing vine, this plant needs a sturdy trellis to scramble on. Because the fruits hang down, it is ideal for arch-shaped trellises.</p>

<p>As with all members of the melon family, this plant is bee pollinated and produces male and female flowers. To encourage the formation of more fruits, it is best to have at least 3 separate plants growing in the same area to have both male and female flowers available, and to have bee-attracting plants within the garden to encourage pollination. If your garden lacks bees, the plant can also be hand pollinated.</p>

  <h4>Sowing seeds:</h4>
<p>Sow seeds individually in a seedling tray filled with potting mix or seedling mix. Lightly mist the soil until damp, once a day. Seeds should sprout within two weeks.</p>

<p>The seedlings will be vulnerable to high heat and heavy rain and are best kept in a sheltered propagation area or a shaded space with around 4 hours of partial or direct sunlight. </p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Transplanting:</h4>
<p>Seedlings will be ready for transplanting into pots or true ground when they have developed 4 or more leaves, or roughly a week or two after germination. Leave 15-30cm between each plant to encourage more growth and better ventilation. </p>
<br>
	</section>
	
<section>
	<h4>Growing:</h4>
<p>Tomatoes will produce more flowers and thus more fruit when fed with fertilisers high in Phosphorus and Potassium. Plants can be fertilised regularly a month after germination for a fuller crop. </p>
<p>For both vining and shrub varieties, it is a good practice to prune regularly and remove dead leaves and stems to improve ventilation and allow light to reach more of the plant. Regular pruning also decreases the likelihood of pests quickly taking over the plant. Suckers can be removed as part of regular pruning and propagated via divison.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Harvesting:</h4>
<p>Plants can be harvested for fruits around three months after sowing. The best time to harvest the fruit is in the early morning, before 9am.</p>
<p>Tomatoes are generally harvested when ripe, however unripe tomatoes can also be eaten after they have been thoroughly cooked. Ripe tomatoes are shiny, glossy, and will no longer have green spots. They should be easy to pop off the stem with a gentle twist. Seeds can be used from ripe fruit for immediate planting.</p>

	<h4>Propagation:</h4>
	<p>Lettuce is primarily grown from seeds. </p>
	<br>

<section>
	<h4>Common problems &amp; solutions:</h4>
<p>Caterpillars, usually from the Diamondback moth and Tussock moth, can rapidly eat all the leaves of your plant. If your plant has lots of large holes and small brown or black poo pellets scattered around damaged leaves, you likely have a caterpillar infestation. Manually remove the caterpillars by hand and protect your plants with netting.</p>
<p>Leaf miners are fly larvae that eat the leaves from the inside, leaving white lines or patches in their wake. Manually remove damaged leaves and use fine mesh netting to stop the adult flies from laying eggs on the plant again.</p>
<p>Etiolation is characterised by plants growing long and skinny, with weak stems and small leaves. The plants may also sometimes look yellowish. Plants etiolate when they do not get enough sunlight, which results in slow growth and untidy forms. To prevent this, grow plants in environments with enough light for them and make sure that each plant has enough space to prevent overcrowding.</p>
