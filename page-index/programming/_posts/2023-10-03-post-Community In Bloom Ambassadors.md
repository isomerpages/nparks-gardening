<p>The Community in Bloom (CIB) Ambassador Awards recognises individuals who promote the love for gardening amongst the community through various initiatives such as outreach, starting gardens, and more. Since its introduction in 2008, the Awards have celebrated the efforts of our volunteers going above and beyond in contributing to Singapore's gardening movement.</p>

<p>CIB Ambassadors are passionate volunteers with excellent horticulture and gardening skills. They actively share their knowledge with the community and lead gardening projects to improve green spaces around them.
