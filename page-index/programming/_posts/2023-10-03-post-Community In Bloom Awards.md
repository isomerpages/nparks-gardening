	<p>The Community in Bloom (CIB) Awards recognise excellence in gardening efforts by community groups and aim to encourage community gardeners to improve the standards of their gardens while continuing to enjoy gardening as a fun and healthy activity.</p>
	<p>Since 2020, the CIB Awards has been organised annually – CIB Awards (Housing Estates) for community gardens in public and private housing estates in even years (i.e. 2020, 2022), and CIB Awards (Educational Institutions and Organisations) for community gardens in schools and organisations in odd years (i.e. 2021, 2023) to accommodate increasing levels of community participation. This also ensures that due attention and recognition are accorded for each category.</p>

	<p>The judging criteria for the CIB Awards 2024 (Housing Estates) comprise the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Overall Garden Quality</b></li>
		<ul>
			<li>The quality of the garden has a direct impact on how well it co-exists with its surroundings. A garden’s quality is measured by its aesthetic, good horticulture practices and standard of horticultural maintenance.</li>
		</ul>
		<li><b>Level of Community Involvement and Inclusiveness</b></li>
		<ul>
			<li>The consistent involvement of participants is the foundation of a sustainable community garden. Building links and networks with the larger community encourages the sharing of resources and strategies to foster community bonding and promotes the love for gardening.</li>
		</ul>
		<li><b>Biodiversity and Sustainability Efforts</b></li>
		<ul>
			<li>Community gardens serve as engaging educational spaces with opportunities for a wide variety of audiences to learn about horticulture, sustainability, biodiversity and much more. <p></p></li></ul>
