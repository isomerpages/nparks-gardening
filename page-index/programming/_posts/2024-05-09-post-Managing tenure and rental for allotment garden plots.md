<p>Allotment-style gardens have individual gardening plots that are rented out by individuals or families. There are allotment gardens directly managed by <a href="/get-involved/allotment-gardens/">NParks in parklands</a> or managed by Town Councils and Grassroots Organisations in housing estates.</p>
<br>
<h4>Tenure guidelines</h4>
<p>Tenure refers to the conditions under which indivduals can rent out the allotment plot. They generally cover:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The length of time a plot can be rented</li>
	<li>The cost of renting the plot</li>
	<li>Rules and regulations for the rental and continued usage of a plot</li>
	</ul>
<p>As the growing of plants takes time, the recommended duration of the rental tenure for any allotment plot should be between 2 to 3 years. For reference, the NParks allotment gardens have a tenure of 3 years with a rental charge of $57 per year (excluding GST).</p>
<p>Communities starting their own Allotment garden can reference our sample tenure agreement for terms and conditions, and modify them to suit their context. For example, some plots could be set aside for priority groups such wheelchair users for <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/planter-beds/">wheelchair-accessible planter beds</a>, or residents that live nearby.</p>
