	<p>Garden rules are essential for the day-to-day running of a <a href="/get-involved/community-gardens/">Community Garden</a>, and will help structure expectations of gardeners and stakeholders alike. Because every garden is unique, the rules that govern it can also change and evolve over time to meet the community’s needs.</p>
	<p>As a rule of thumb, garden rules should include topics such as safety, <a href="/garden-management/housekeeping/">housekeeping etiquette</a>, management expectations and a contact for gardeners to follow up with should they have questions or suggestions.</p>
	<p>Here is a sample of a set of garden rules that you can use as reference as you create your own!</p>
	<ol>
		<li>All gardening tools must be kept neatly in the garden shed when not in use.</li>
	<li>Always ensure that the water tap is tightly closed after use to prevent wasting water.</li>
		<li>Gardeners are only allowed to plant plants in their designated planting plot.</li>
		<li>Always be courteous to one another, and ask before you take cuttings or plants from other plots.</li>
		<li>Ensure that pathways within the garden are free of weeds, litter, debris and sprawling plants.</li>
		<li>No structures above 1.5m in height from ground level are allowed. Approval is needed from the Garden Leader to proceed.</li>
		<li>Gardeners are to abide with NEA guidelines on preventing <a href="/page-index/housekeeping/keeping-gardens-mosquito-free/">mosquito breeding.</a></li>
		<li>Be respectful of residents nearby and keep your volume low before 7am and after 7pm.</li>
		<li>Smoking and the use of open flames are not allowed in the garden.</li>
		<li>Acts of violence, misconduct and mischief are not allowed within the garden. Should such incidents occur, the Garden Leader and Grassroots organisation reserves the right to terminate group member’s involvement in the community garden.</li>
