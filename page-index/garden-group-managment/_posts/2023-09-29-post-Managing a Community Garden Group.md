	<p>Managing a community of gardeners is no easy feat. Detailed planning, efficient delegation and clear communication is needed to sustain the group and keep the Community Garden running. Thankfully, there are some management strategies that can be used to keep volunteers happy and productive.</p>

	<h5>Assigning volunteer roles</h5>
	<p>Assigning specific roles will help your volunteers develop a sense of ownership and responsibility towards the community garden. It is crucial to know what your volunteers are interested in to maximise their strength in their assigned roles. Taking time to know your individual volunteers and working with them to choose their roles will make this process easier, and will pay off in the long run.</p> 
	<p>Here are some examples of roles that you can consider for your gardening group:</p>
	<ul class="jekyllcodex_accordion">
		<li><input type="checkbox" id="accordion1">
		<label for="accordion1">Garden Leader and co-leader</label><div>
			<ul>
				<li>Guide and direct the gardening group over a set term (e.g. 1-3 years)</li>
				<li>Act as a liaison between the gardening group and other stakeholders, e.g. Residents’ Committee (RC), Neighbourhood Committee (NC), Residents’ Network (RN), NParks, Town Council, Management Corporation Strata Title (MCST)</li>
				<li>Ensure gardening rules, policies and advisories are adhered to</li>
			</ul>
		</div></li>
		<li><input type="checkbox" id="accordion2">
		<label for="accordion2">Treasurer</label><div>
			<ul>
				<li>Secure and handle funds and financial matters for the gardening group</li>
			</ul>
		</div></li>

				<li>Communicate with the rest of the group on activities and events</li>
				<li>Create content for flyers, brochures and social media posts to promote the garden and engage members of the group</li>
			</ul>
		</div></li>
		<li><input type="checkbox" id="accordion4">
		<label for="accordion4">Volunteer and Recruitment Coordinator</label><div>
			<ul>
				<li>Recruit new volunteers and create a contact log for communication purposes</li>

	</ul>

	<h5>Goal setting and calendar of events</h5>
	<p>Setting goals is a good way to keep your gardening group united and on track. Working as a team, volunteers can discuss and coordinate to plan projects for the year and beyond.</p>
	<p>Based on the goals and objectives discussed, the community can then plan a calendar of events and activities. This calendar will help you break down a bigger goal into numerous, more manageable short-term steps towards the final goal. Below is a sample calendar of events for reference:</p>

	<h5>Sustaining interest in gardening</h5>
	<img src="/images/Gardeners/Outreach%20(2).jpg">
	<p>Gardeners that learn are gardeners that improve! Scheduling learning journeys to other Community Gardens, attending gardening events, and collaborating with other stakeholders are fun ways to enrich your community’s gardening experience by exposing them to new ideas and techniques. If your community is up for the challenge, they can also consider joining the Community In Bloom Awards to show off their garden, or develop their outreach skills to become a Community In Bloom ambassador.</p>
