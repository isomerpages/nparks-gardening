	<p>Containers are a gardener’s best friend because they are a versatile way to grow plants almost anywhere. Whether they are conventional pots, troughs, raised planters, vertical wall pots or upcycled, there are some principals to gardening in containers that will help you grow your potted plants to their fullest!</p>

	<h4>Container material</h4>
	<p>Anything that is waterproof and can hold soil could potentially become a container for your plants. Many store-bought containers are made from plastic, metal, glass, clay, or wood, and upcycled pots are often made from the same materials.</p>

		<label for="accordion1">Plastic</label><div>

			<p>Plastic containers are light, flexible and cheap. They also do not heat up easily and come in a wide variety of styles. However, thinner plastics will break down quickly when exposed to the sun, while thicker plastics can last longer. Most plastic pots will last between 1-10 years.</p>

		<label for="accordion2">Metal</label><div>

			<p>Metal containers look stylish and rustic, but they tend to be heavy and can heat up quickly in direct sunlight. They are best used in shady gardens, which will prevent plants and gardeners burning themselves on the hot metal. Metal is a long-lived material, especially when coated with anti-rust paint. These containers can easily last 5-10 years.</p>

		<li><input type="checkbox" id="accordion3">
		<label for="accordion3">Glass</label><div>
			<img title="Glass containers being used for indoor planting. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Hardscapes/Growlight_JacChua%20(1).jpg">
			<p>Glass containers are particularly eye-catching for indoor spaces, and are generally classy additions to your garden. However, they are heavy and delicate, and thus need to be handled with care. Glass also tends to heat up in the sun, and is prone to algal growth. Glass also rarely comes with drainage holes, so care must be taken while <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering/">watering</a> to prevent <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot/">waterlogging</a> the whole container. If kept well, glass containers can last 10 years or more.</p>

		<li><input type="checkbox" id="accordion4">
		<label for="accordion4">Clay</label><div>

			<p>Clay containers are traditionally used for gardening and are often the most common pots you can find after plastic. They are tougher than glass, but they are still heavy and can shatter. Unglazed clay pots will dry out faster than glazed pots, but both are long-lived and reliable materials that can last for more than 10 years.</p>

		<label for="accordion5">Wood</label><div>

<p>Wooden containers are light and stylish, but they do tend to rot within three years even when coated with varnish in the tropics. Most wooden containers exposed to the sun and rain last up to about 5 years at most.</p>

	<h4>Drainage</h4>
	<img title="Drainage holes at the bottom of a pot. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Hardscapes/drainageholes_jacchua.jpg">
	<p>The most common problem container gardeners have is <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-rot">root rot</a>. This is generally caused by a lack of drainage in pots, which leads to roots sitting too long in water with no oxygen, causing them to suffocate to death and rotting.   
Having drainage holes at the bottom of your container will prevent this. Drainage in containers can also be further improved by using broken pot shards or a fine mesh at the bottom of the container to protect the drainage holes from being clogged by soil.</p>
	<p>Some containers can be easily modified to add drainage holes. A piece of hot metal like a soldering iron can be used to make holes in thin plastic, while a drill can be used for thicker plastic, metal, wood or concrete.</p>

	<h4>Size</h4>
	<p>Container sizes will affect two major things for growing plants:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>How much space roots will have to grow</li>
		<li>How fast the soil dries out</li>
		</ol>
		<img title="A vertical wall pocket system growing leafy vegetables. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Hardscapes/ContainerGardening_JacChua%20(8).jpg">
	<p>Smaller pots will have less space for roots, and will dry out faster. This makes them ideal for plants that naturally have shallow roots and that are sensitive to <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogging</a>, like most small leafy vegetables. Small pots are also ideal for maximising odd or small spaces, like walls.</p> 
	<img title="Climbing plants have larger root balls and thus need larger pots as the plant needs more water to support itself. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Hardscapes/Trellis_JacChua.jpg">
	<p>Larger pots are important for growing plants with large root balls, as they need more soil to keep hydrated and stable. Climbing plants, trees, and large shrubs all need larger and deeper pots to grow well. </p>

	<p>Small containers are useful for filling up small spaces, and can also be stacked to make vertical wall plantings. They are ideal for plants with shallow roots, like small leafy vegetables, as they will drain quickly and are less likely to be <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/waterlogging/">waterlogged</a>. However, plants can quickly get root-bound, in which the roots hit the sides of the pot and start to grow back in towards existing roots or escape through the drainage holes. This usually results in the plant wilting suddenly or becoming stunted.  Remove the plant from its old pot and tease part the roots before replanting it in a pot at least 10cm larger in diameter and depth to remedy this. </p>
	<p>Larger containers hold more soil, and therefore can hold more roots and a larger plant. Ensuring that your pot is big enough for your plant’s root ball will encourage growth and keep the plant stable.</p>

	<p>Size also affects how fast the soil dries out. Larger containers need to be watered less since there is more soil to hold more water. A good way to gauge how much water is in the soil is by lifting the whole container to see how heavy it is. Dry pots are always much lighter! You can fully saturate the soil with water via the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/bottom-watering">bottom watering method</a> to see the difference.</p>

	<h4>Refreshing your container soil</h4>
	<img title="A gardener using a fork to break compacted soil. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Horti%20techniques/Soil_Breaking_JacChua.jpg">
	<p>Container soil can become compacted and nutrient-poor after some time. It is a good practice to refresh your soil at least once a year. Old container soil can be refreshed by breaking it up and adding 2 parts compost to 1 part old container soil to keep it soft with good drainage. Adding some slow-release organic fertilizer like Vermicast will help to replenish nutrients, and encourage new roots to settle in.</p>

		<h4>Upcyling</h4>

<p>Waterproof containers like takeaway boxes, tins, and bottles can be readily upcycled to make pots. Making and decorating upcycled pots is a fun bonding activity, and can be paired with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">propagating cuttings</a> to make gifts!</p>
