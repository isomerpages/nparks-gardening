	<ol>
		<li><strong>Identify your pests</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li>Identifying pests correctly is the most important part of pest management. Different pests will need different management methods, so being specific is the most efficient way.</li>
				<li>Use our <a href="/digital-tools/pestid/">pest identifier tool</a> and explore<a href="/page-index/pests/pests/"> pest pages</a> to learn about pests and their life cycles!</li>
			</ul>
		<li><strong>Monitor for pests</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/finding-pests/">Check your garden regularly for plant pests</a>, ideally whenever you visit the garden.</li>
				<li>Plants that are overgrown, with distorted or holey leaves, discoloration, damaged stems, or slow growth might be harbouring pests! Look for them wherever something looks amiss.</li>
			</ul>
		<li><strong>Tolerance</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li>Strive for ecological balance rather than perfect aesthetics.</li>
				<li>It is generally not possible to have a garden completely free of pests without also affecting beneficial biodiversity, like <a href="/page-index/biodiversity/pollinators/">pollinators</a>.</li>
			</ul>
		<li><strong>Prevention</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li>The first line of pest control is to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">prevent the pest</a> from becoming a threat.</li>
				<li>Keeping plants healthy, using hardscapes like <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a>, quarantining new plants, regular pest checks and general maintenance are good ways to prevent pests from taking over your garden. </li>
			</ul>
		<li><strong>Control</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li>There are various methods for controlling pests, including cultural, mechanical, biological and chemical. </li>
				<li>Chemical control should always be the last resort, as improper use of pesticides may cause damage to your health and the environment.</li>
				<li>Learn about <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/">different pest control methods</a>, and how they should be used.</li>
			</ul>
