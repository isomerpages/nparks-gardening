	<p>Soil amendments are materials that change the <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">properties of soil</a> when mixed in. Soil amendments are not the same as fertilisers, which are materials that release nutrients for plant growth. </p>

	<p>They are largely split into organic and inorganic amendments, with some common types listed below:</p>

	<h4>Organic soil amendments</h4>
	<p>Organic soil amendments are made from living things, usually other plants. They generally help to retain moisture and increase drainage in soil as the organic particles soak water up like a sponge, but after a certain point will allow whatever water they can’t absorb to drain away. This makes soil soft and moist, but not waterlogged. Organic particles will also make soil soft and airy, reducing compaction and making it easier for roots to grow. Organic soil amendments will eventually decompose and will need to be replaced. These soil amendments also feed your soil biodiversity, such as earthworms.</p>

		<p><b>Cocopeat or coco coir</b> is a by-product of coconut husks and looks like fine brown particles that can rapidly expand in water. It is usually sold in dehydrated blocks that can expand up to 7 times their original volume when placed in water for rehydration. Rehydrated coco coir can be mixed into soil as an alternative to compost or peat. Coco coir is also much more sterile than compost and can be used for starting seeds.</p>

		<label for="accordian2">Coco Fibre</label><div>

		<p><b>Coco fibre</b> is also made from coconut husks, but the material is not ground down as finely and still looks like clumps of rough hair or chips. Coco fibre can also be directly mixed in with soil, but it is much chunkier and will not mix as readily as coco coir. Coco fibre is usually used as a lining for pots, or as a mulch. It can also be used as an alternative to sphagnum moss.</p>
	</div></li>
	<li><input type="checkbox" id="accordian3">
		<label for="accordian3">Charcoal</label><div>
		<p><b>Charcoal</b> is made from burned woody matter, like hardwoods or coconut husks. It can be bought in various sizes, from large logs to shards. It is very porous and can be used to improve soil drainage and aeration when mixed in. Larger pieces are often used as a medium for epiphytic plants like orchids to attach their roots to. It can also be used to absorb odours up to a point, making it a useful addition to unbalanced compost piles and terrariums. However, it is very alkaline and can change the pH of your soil and can also absorb and bind to fertilisers so strongly that your plants don’t get to absorb any!</p>

		<label for="accordian4">Mature Compost</label><div>
		<img title="Compost is made from decomposed organic matter. Photo by Jacqueline Chua" src="/images/Horti%20techniques/Compost_Jacchua.jpg">
		<p><b>Mature compost</b> is one of the most readily available soil amendments as it can be made at home or bought from nurseries. Mature compost should have a soft, fine texture and smell earthy. Compost with large chunks of rotting matter that smells unpleasant is immature, and not ready for use. It is important to use mature compost that is no longer decomposing as actively rotting material in immature compost can lock up nitrogen, which will stunt plant growth. Mature compost will have trace amounts of nutrients, which can also give a bit of a boost to your plants.</p>

	<li><input type="checkbox" id="accordian5">
		<label for="accordian5">Coco Fibre</label><div>
		<p><b>Peat moss</b> is decomposed moss harvested from the bottom of peat bogs and is traditionally a favored soil amendment as it is spongy and yet drains well. Peat moss particles are much smaller than sphagnum moss clumps, making it easier to mix into soil. Like sphagnum moss, its use has led to the degradation of peat bogs and is not sustainable in the long run. Consider replacing your peat moss use with more sustainable alternatives like mature compost or cocopeat. </p>

	<li><input type="checkbox" id="accordian6">
		<label for="accordian6">Sphagnum Moss</label><div>
		<p><b>Sphagnum moss</b> is dried moss harvested live from peat bogs and is often packed into a dehydrated block like coco coir. It is stringy and spongy when rehydrated, making it a popular amendment for plants that need moisture and high drainage at the same time, like epiphytic orchids or kokedama plants. Unfortunately, harvesting sphagnum moss from peat bogs comes with a very high environmental toll, and is not sustainable in the long run. Consider replacing your sphagnum moss with more sustainable materials, like cocopeat.</p>

	<h4>Inorganic soil amendments</h4>
	<p>Inorganic soil amendments are usually made from materials that are mined or man-made. They are generally used to increase the drainage and aeration of the soil and to create air pockets to help roots breathe. These soil amendments will not decompose and generally only need to be added once. They come in different granule sizes, with large, coarse grain sizes used for large containers and raised beds, and smaller grain sizes used for seed starting and small containers. </p>
	<img title="Burnt earth is hard, porous and well draining. Photo by Jacqueline Chua" src="/images/Horti%20techniques/SoilAmendment_BurntEarth_Jacchua.jpg">
	<p><b>Burnt earth</b> consists of chunks of clay that has been exposed to heat, making it porous and granular. It allows for better drainage and more air to reach the roots because it maintains its crumbly texture when fresh but may revert to being wet and sticky with prolonged use. Large chunks are preferred for mixing into soil as fine grains and dust from burnt earth tends to stick together in a thick layer at the bottom of the pot. Sieve out the larger parts from the dust before use. Burnt earth can be used in the place of clay soil to make a loamy soil mix from scratch. </p>
	<img title="Pumice is a lightweight and porous rock that comes in various grain sizes. Photo by Jacqueline Chua" src="/images/Horti%20techniques/SoilAmendment_Grit_Jacchua%20(4).jpg">
	<p><b>Pumice</b> refers to a lightweight volcanic rock that is highly porous. It increases drainage and aeration when mixed into soil, and is a popular soil additive for succulent, cacti and bonsai mixes. Pumice has lots of pores that can help to hold some water for plant roots to absorb, but allows excess water to drain away, thus preventing root rot. It is often used in rooting cuttings and in container gardening. </p>
	<img title="" src="/images/Horti%20techniques/Soil_Sandy_Jacchua.jpg">
	<p><b>Horticultural Sand</b> generally refers to river sand or coarse sand with grains larger than 2mm. It should not clump together when wet, and helps to increase the drainage and aeration of soil when mixed in. Coarser grains are generally preferred as fine sand mixed with clay soils will make a medium like concrete.  It can get heavy and dense in large amounts and should generally be mixed with organic amendments like compost to make a lighter soil mix that roots can grow through. </p>
	<p><b>Perlite</b>, or expanded pyrite, is a lightweight volcanic rock that is highly porous and resembles styrofoam. It is made by heating pyrite until it “pops” like popcorn. It drastically increases drainage and aeration when mixed into soil and keeps it loose. Perlite grains also have lots of crevices that can help to hold some water for plant roots to absorb, but allows excess water to drain away, thus preventing root rot. It is often used in rooting cuttings, seed-starting mixes and in container gardening. Unfortunately, because it is so light, perlite tends to float to the top in lightweight soil mixes during watering and can be blown away by the wind. It needs to be mixed back into the soil periodically. Cheaper bags of perlite might have dust, which can cause irritation when inhaled. Use gloves and a face mask when handling it for safety.</p>
	<p><b>Vermiculite</b> is a mineral that expands when heated, forming lightweight flakes that are highly porous. It increases drainage when mixed into soil and keeps it loose. Vermiculite flakes also absorb water like a sponge, making it a useful material to keep plants moist. It is often used in rooting cuttings, seed-starting mixes and in container gardening. Unfortunately, because it is so light, vermiculite tends to float to the top in lightweight soil mixes during watering and can be blown away by the wind. It needs to be mixed back into the soil periodically.</p>
