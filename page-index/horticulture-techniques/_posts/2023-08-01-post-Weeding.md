<p>Weeding is a key part of plant maintenance as weeds can quickly overwhelm your own plants and crowd them out. Weeding effectively and consistently will keep your garden neat and manageable in the long run.  </p>

<h4>What is a weed and how do they affect your plants?</h4>

<p>Any plant that you donâ€™t want in a particular spot can be considered a weed.  They are undesirable when they grow and spread faster than your selected plants and can overwhelm weak or sick plants rapidly.  </p>

<h4>How to weed</h4>

<p>Weed control should be done early and regularly, especially if you have exposed soil or young plants. Use a spade or a gardening fork to pull out the entire weed, including its roots. Some weeds are hardy enough to regrow from even a tiny bit of stem left behind! Use a pair of gloves to protect yourself from thorns, stones and sap. </p>
<p>You can also use mulch to kill and suppress weeds. Mulch will deprive weeds and their seedlings of light, thus killing them. </p>
<p>Avoid using broad-spectrum herbicides as they are harmful for the environment. </p>
