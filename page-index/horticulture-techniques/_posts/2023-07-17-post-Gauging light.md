  <p>Sunlight is essential for proper growth of your plants. It provides light energy for plants to photosynthesise, a process where plants convert water, carbon dioxide and light energy to glucose. Depending on how much light different areas of your garden receives in a day, it determines the types of plants you can grow. Therefore, it is important for you to do sun mapping – creating a map of your garden and mark out areas where the sun hits at different times of the day.</p>

	<h4>What is considered full sun, partial sun and shade?</h4>
  <p>Simply put, an area that receives full sun daily generally get 6-8 hours of direct sunlight. This means that sunlight is not obstructed and hits directly onto the leaves of the plants.</p>
	<p>Areas that receive partial sun have 4-6 hours of direct sun daily. Ideally, this would be in the morning and not during the hottest time of the day.</p>
	<p>Dappled sun, or dappled shade, is similar to partial sun. Areas that have dappled sun usually get filtered sunlight, usually shaded by trees above.</p>
	<p>Full shade areas receive anything less than 4 hours of sunlight in the morning or afternoon.</p>

	<h4>What is the best for an edibles garden?</h4>
	<p>Full sun is the best for an edibles garden. With full sun, you will be able to grow a wide range of fruiting plants as well as leafy greens. However, you will still be able to have a beautiful garden if you understand the amount of light your garden receives and chose suitable plants accordingly.</p>

	<h4>How do I measure sunlight for my garden?</h4>
	<p>Draw a simple map of your garden – take note of existing buildings, structures, trees and waterbodies, as well as your garden boundaries.</p>
	<p>Add the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, West), preferably on the top corner of your map.</p>
	<p>Visit your garden at 4 different times of the day, on a sunny day – visit your garden preferably at 9:00am, 12:00pm, 3:00pm and 6:00pm. You may use your handphone to take a picture of your garden to help you keep a record. Ensure that the picture is taken from the same spot, from a higher ground where you can see the overview of your garden.</p>
	<p>Map out on the simple map of your garden areas that are being shaded out and areas that receives direct sunlight. This will tell you the amount of light you receive at different parts of the garden throughout the day. Select your plants accordingly.</p>
