	<h4>Using safe soil and water</h4>

	<p>Using <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">soil</a> and <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/watering/">water</a> from known and reliable sources is important as microbes, pollutants and other harmful substances can make your crops unsafe to eat. Pollutants from sewage are of great concern and can make you sick if they are consumed after they touch your edible plants. </p>
	<p>In the same vein, raw manure can contain pathogens, and should not be used as <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertiliser</a> directly in the garden to prevent contamination of soil and water. Always use processed fertilisers from reliable sources to stay safe.</p>

	<p>Excessive use of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/#chemical_control">pesticides</a> can contaminate crops and cause pose health risks if used incorrectly. Using <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/ipm/">integrated pest management methods</a>, like netting, regular pruning and companion planting is better for your garden biodiversity and keeps your produce uncontaminated.</p>
	<p>It is best practice to only use pesticides made from food-safe materials to control pests on crops. If any pesticide is used, observe a waiting period of at least a week between application and harvest for safety.</p>
