	<p><b>True ground planting</b> requires a lot of hard work and the luxury of space. This is because most sites in Singapore naturally have heavy clay soil that is difficult to work with and will need gradual improvement. However, soil will naturally improve the longer that it has been planted in, and your true ground planting will yield many benefits in the long run.</p>

	<h4>Improving soil</h4>

	<p> Raw, sticky clay soil will need lots of compost mixed in to make it soft and improve drainage to grow plants. A good starting ratio for the first planting in true ground is one part existing soil to three parts compost to make the soil soft and porous enough for healthy roots and good drainage. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">Fertilisers</a> can also be mixed into the soil to boost plant growth. This newly mixed soil can be backfilled into your new planting space.</p>
	<p>It is best to backfill your planting space at least 15cm deep for small shrubby plants like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/sissoo-spinach/">Sissoo Spinach</a> and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/bayam/">Bayam</a>, and at least 20cm for larger plants like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/brinjal/">Brinjals</a>, <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/ladys-finger/">Ladyâ€™s-Fingers</a> and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/thai-basil/">Thai Basil</a>. Fruiting climbers like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/passionfruit/">Passionfruit</a> and <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/cucumber/">Cucumbers</a> have very large root balls and do best with improved soil at least 30cm deep.</p>

	<h4>Direct Sowing of seeds</h4>
	<img style="height:350px; width:350px" title="Seeds being sown in a furrow directly in true ground." src="/images/Graphics/Animated/gif_seedsowing3.gif">
	<p>Furrows or planting holes can be made for <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">direct seed sowing</a> with specialized tools, a spade handle, or even chopsticks. Fill the bottom of the furrow or hole halfway with compost or seed starting mix, add your seeds, and cover them again with the compost or seed starting mix. Take care not to over-bury your seeds; most small seeds like those of <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/bayam/">Bayam</a> just need to be covered by about 0.5-1cm of soil, while larger seeds like those of <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/cucumber/">Cucumbers</a> and Kang Kong can be buried by 1-2cm of soil.</p>
	<p>Water the seeds lightly after direct sowing and observe your newly sown seeds regularly. Young plants tend to be targeted by <a href="/page-index/pests/pests/">pests</a> like slugs, snails, rodents, or birds, and can be protected with a <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches/">DIY cloche</a> or <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a>.</p>

	<h4>Transplanting</h4>
	<img title="Filling the bottom of a transplanting hole with compost and organic fertiliser before transplanting to aid root growth." src="">
	<p>It is a good practice to dig down to 5-10cm lower than the needed root depth and fill the bottom of the planting hole with additional compost and some organic fertilizer to encourage root growth. Backfill the remaining space with existing soil and top with compost to serve as a mulch for the newly transplanted plant.</p>

	<h4>Soil management</h4>
	<img title="Exposed soil that is hard, compacted and dry. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Horti%20techniques/DryGround_Jacchua.jpg">
	<p>Exposed soil will gradually be washed away by heavy rains, dried out by intense sunlight and compacted by walking. Planting groundcovers like sweet potato and Ceylon spinach will prevent this and will also keep your soil microbiome healthy. Regular planting will break up clay soil and introduce organic matter over time, eventually improving raw clay soil to loamy soil. This can take anywhere between 2-5 years, depending on the intensity of the planting.</p>
	<p>Growing plants that can tolerate waterlogging and that readily grow in clay soil is also a good way to start improving true ground planting beds. Some common plants used for this are Pandan, Kang Kong, Taro, Guava and River Tarenna.</p>

	<h4>Alternatives to planting in true ground</h4>
	<img title="Raised beds growing vegetables. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Hardscapes/PlanterBed%20(15).jpg">
	<p>If the existing soil is too difficult to work with, a raised bed can be built on top of it and then filled with better soil. Container planting can also be considered but is generally not encouraged given that many containers can look cluttered, and harbour pests like snails in between the pots.</p>
