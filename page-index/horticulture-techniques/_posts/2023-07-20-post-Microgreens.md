	<p>Microgreens are sprouts that are allowed to grow leaves, and can be eaten raw in salads or stir-fried. Because they are not meant to grow for long before they are eaten, microgreens can be grown indoors and with little light under two weeks.</p>

	<p>The steps for sprouting microgreens are:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Cover the bottom of an old food container or plastic box with potting mix, a kitchen towel or a wet cloth. The material should be 2-5cm thick.</li> 
		<li>Scatter the seeds evenly on the surface of the planting medium.</li>  
		<li>Mist the seeds and planting medium till damp with a fine spray. Do not spray till the seeds are swimming in water.</li> 
		<li>Weigh the seeds down with another similarly sized container to make sure the seeds are fully in contact with the planting medium.</li> 
		<li>Place the seeds in a dark area like a cupboard for a few days till they sprout. They should sprout within a week.</li>  
		<li>Mist the seeds daily till damp, but not soaked.</li> 
		<li>Remove the weight once the seeds begin sprouting and move the microgreens to a brighter area. Continue to mist the seedlings once a day.</li> 
		<li>Microgreens can be eaten from the moment they have leaves. They can also be kept for another week to grow a bit bigger before harvest.</li>  
		<li>Harvest the microgreens with a clean pair of secateurs.</li>  
	</ol>
