description: Transplanting is the act of moving a plant to grow from one place
  to another. Seedlings, cuttings, and root-bound plants all need to be
  transplanted into new pots, true ground, or wherever the full-size plant
  should be growing. Learn more about transplanting here.

	<p>Transplanting is the act of moving a plant to grow from one place to another. <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">Seedlings</a>, <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">cuttings</a>, and <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-bound/">root-bound</a> plants all need to be transplanted into new <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">pots</a>, <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>, or wherever the full-size plant should be growing. </p>

	<h4>What can be transplanted?</h4>
	<p>It is important to transplant <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-seed/">seedlings</a> when they have 4-8 leaves and healthy <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/propagating-by-cuttings/">cuttings</a> with new growth. This is because plants regularly go through a process called <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/transplanting-shock/">transplanting shock</a> after they are transplanted, which may cause the newly transplanted plant to drop their older leaves as they redirect their energy into growing new roots and shoots. Very young seedlings and unhealthy cuttings will have a higher risk of dying before they take root after transplanting.</p>

		 <li>
			 <img title="A gardener preparing a large pot for transplanting tomato seedlings. Photo by NParks." src="/images/Horti%20techniques/Soil_Mixing_JacChua.jpg">
			 <p>Make sure that the new planting area, be it a pot, planter bed, or true ground is <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/plant-spacing/">large enough</a> with the appropriate soil depth for the fully-grown plant. Prepare the  <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil/">soil</a> and remove <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/weeding/">weeds</a> from the planting area.</p>
		</li> 
		<li>

			<p>Gently remove the seedling or cutting from its container.</p>

			<p>Check the health of your plant. Healthy seedlings and rooted cuttings have white roots. If any roots are dark, soft and slimy, they are rotting. Cut off rotting roots before proceeding.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<img title="A gardener digging a hole in the larger pot to plant a tomato seedling. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Horti%20techniques/transplants_tomato%20(3)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
			<p>Dig a hole in the soil deep enough to cover the roots of your seedling or cutting.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<img title="A gardener gently pushing down on the soil around a seedling to keep it upright. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Horti%20techniques/transplants_tomato%20(1)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
			<p>Plant the seedling or cutting in the soil. The soil should cover all the roots.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<img title="Watering seedlings daily after transplanting. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Horti%20techniques/watering%20(1)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
			<p>Water your plants immediately after transplanting. These transplants may get <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/transplanting-shock">transplanting shock</a> after a day or so. Freshly transplanted plants should be protected with <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">shade netting</a> or kept in a shaded area with at least <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4 hours of indirect sunlight</a> and watered daily for a week while they recover. This recovery period is also a good time to <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/fertilising/">fertilise</a> the transplants to encourage them to grow more roots, shoots and leaves.</p>
