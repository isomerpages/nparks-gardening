	<p>Crop rotation is the practice of changing crop types every harvest cycle or so. It is a good practice to reduce pest loads as different crops will attract different pests, so rotating the type of plant you grow in your garden will stop a single type of pest from overwhelming your crops. This technique is part of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/#cultural_control">cultural control</a>, which in turn is used in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/ipm/">integrated pest management</a>.</p>
