	<p>Crop rotation is the practice of changing crop types every harvest cycle or so. It is a good practice to reduce pest loads as different crops will attract different pests, so rotating the type of plant you grow in your garden will stop a single type of pest from overwhelming your crops. This technique is part of <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/pest-control/#cultural_control">cultural control</a>, which in turn is used in <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/ipm/">integrated pest management</a>.</p>

	<h4>Crop rotation basics</h4>
	<p>Pests like <a href="/page-index/pests/leaf-miner/">Leaf miners</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/whiteflies/">Whiteflies</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/caterpillars/">Caterpillars</a> are more likely to infest some crops than others, while more generalist pests like <a href="/page-index/pests/aphids/">Aphids</a>, <a href="/page-index/pests/mealy-bugs/">Mealy Bugs</a>, and <a href="/page-index/pests/spider-mites/">Spider mites</a> are likely to remain on and attack unhealthy plants. Rotating your crops will reduce the food sources of the established pests, and will help you find what thrives in your garden's unique environment.</p>
	<p>Crops used for rotation will need to have similar growing requirements, but are different enough such that the same pests are unable to attack every type of crop. For example, a simple crop rotation schedule for an allotment gardener with <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">full sunlight</a> could start with a a leafy vegetable like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/lettuce/">Lettuce</a>, swap to a species of bean like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/butterfly-pea/">Butterfly Peas</a>, change to herb like <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/chives/">Chives</a>, and then back to a leafy vegetable.</p>
	<p>Short-lived <a href="/learn-more-about-gardening/glossary/#a">annual</a> crops are best for this practice, with the harvest of these crops <a href="/digital-tools/sowing-planner/"> planned in	advance to coincide with a </a><a href="/page-index/garden-group-management/managing-a-community-garden-group/">garden's calendar of events</a>.</p></section>
