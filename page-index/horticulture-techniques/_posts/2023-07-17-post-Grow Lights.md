<p>The biggest hurdle to growing plants indoor is having enough light. Using a grow light can remedy many issues with indoor gardening, and give you the flexibility of growing anywhere in your home and not be reliant on sunlight coming through your windows. </p>

<h4>Understanding the light that plants need</h4>

<p>Light intensity is measured in <b>lumens (lm)</b> for most household lights. <b>Lumens</b> is a basic unit of measurement for light brightness as perceived by the human eye.</p>
<p>However, what may seem to be bright to our eyes may not appear as bright to plants. A light fixture that has more blue and red light would have lower lumens than a green and yellow light which our eyes are more sensitive to.</p>  
<p>The light spectrum range useful for plant growth is defined as <b>Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR)</b> which refers to the wavelength from 400nm to 700nm. This is shown in the graph below.

</p><p>To determine how much useful light is reaching your plants, you will need to understand the <b>Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD)</b> value. Its unit in is </p><p>Âµmol/m<sup>2</sup>/s, which measures the number of photons in the suitable spectra range received by the plant surface at a certain time.</p>
<p>The larger the value, the more usable light by plants is reaching the plant surface. This value can be found in the specifications for various grow lights.</p>

<h4>Choosing the right light for your environment and plant needs</h4>
<p>There are many types of light to choose from for your indoor plants. From the usual LED table lamp to high-intensity discharge lamps (HID), it depends on the factors shown below.</p>

<h4>LED household lights or grow lights?</h4>
		<img style="height:390px; width:520px" src="/images/Hardscapes/Growlight_JacChua%20(1).jpg">
<p>LED household lights contain red and blue wavelengths within the light spectrum which are necessary for photosynthesis albeit at lower intensity.
</p><p>Grow lights are specially modified to produce more light in the red and blue wavelengths which allows for better plant growth. Hence, they may be more expensive due to the customised design. If you wish to grow shade-loving plants in your indoor garden, regular LED bulbs would suffice as they are energy-efficient and generally inexpensive.</p>
