	<p>Fertilisers are substances packed with nutrients for plants, and can come in the form of pellets, liquid, granules or powders. They are used to improve plant growth and yields and can also be used to address nutrient deficiencies. They can be made from chemicals or derived from organic sources. Fertilisers from organic sources should be processed before use, as raw manure, bones, or blood can carry pathogens or cause disease.</p>

<section>
	<h4>Major nutrients</h4>
	<p>The main nutrients fertilisers provide are <b>Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P)</b> and <b>Potassium (K)</b>. They are displayed as a ratio on the packaging of most fertilisers in that order. The ratios will indicate whether the fertiliser has more of one nutrient than the others.</p>
	<p><b>Balanced fertilisers</b> (for example, 5:5:5) will be used to generally boost plant growth.</p>
	<p><b>High nitrogen fertilisers</b> (for example, 5:3:3) encourages more leaf growth. Organic fertilisers high in nitrogen include those made from manure, with common sources being chickens, cows, or goats.</p>
	<p><b>High phosphorus and potassium fertilisers</b> (for example, 3:5:5) are used to encourage flowering, fruiting and root growth. Organic fertilisers high in phosphorus and potassium include those made from seaweed, blood, and bones.</p>

	<h4>Other nutrients</h4>
<p>	Plants also need other nutrients like <b>Magnesium (Mg)</b>, <b>Iron (Fe)</b>, and <b>Calcium (Ca)</b>, but in smaller amounts. <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/nutrient-deficiencies/">Deficiencies in these nutrients</a> are less common, and can generally be resolved by fixing problems with the soil. The only exception to this is Magnesium, which can be added to the soil through the use of epsom salts. </p>
	<p> <b>Epsom salts</b> are usually used as beauty products, but they can also be dissolved in water to be used as a fertiliser to remedy magnesium nutrient deficiencies in plants. Mix 1 tablespoon of epsom salt in 2 litres of water to apply once a month to your plants. Epsom salt should be used sparingly as a fertiliser, as overly salty soil might kill your plant! </p>

	<h4>Fertiliser types</h4>
	<p>Fast-release fertilisers will make nutrients available to plants immediately after they are applied. They usually come in a powdered or liquid form, and plants will have a noticeable growth spurt the week after they are added.</p>
	<p>Slow-release fertilisers will release nutrients over a long period of time, and usually come in the form of pellets or granules. These are a better long-term solution to nutrient deficiency problems.</p>

	<h4>How do I apply fertiliser?</h4>
	<p>Fertilisers will generally come with instructions for application and will vary based on product. The most common ways are:</p>
	<img title="A Community Gardener scattering fertiliser onto a new planting bed as top dressing. Photo by NParks." src="/images/Gardeners/Fertilising.jpg">
	<p>As <b>top dressing</b> in which fertilisers are scattered on the surface of the ground around plants, and then watered in. This is a fast way to spread fertiliser, but care needs to be taken to avoid touching leaves with fertiliser pellets or powders, which can cause burns.</p>
	<img title="Community Gardeners mixing soil. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Gardeners/Digging%20(4).jpg">
	<p>As <b>base dressing</b>, in which fertilisers are directly mixed into soil. The best time to add base dressing to soil is before new plants are transplanted into their permanent growing place.</p>
	<img title="A Community Gardener watering plants with diluted liquid fertiliser. Photo by NParks." src="/images/Gardeners/Planting%20(1).jpg">
	<p>Via <b>watering</b>, in which fertiliser is mixed with water and applied directly to plant roots. Care needs to be taken to avoid touching leaves with fertiliser liquid, which can cause burns.</p>
	<p>Take care to always apply fertiliser in moderation, as overuse of fertiliser can cause algal blooms in waterways and encourage the growth of weeds!</p>

	<h4>When do I fertilise my plants?</h4>
	<p>It is best to fertilise your plants during dry weather, as rain can wash your freshly applied fertiliser away. Plants also will benefit from fertilisers during times of stress, like after transplanting or hard pruning.</p>
