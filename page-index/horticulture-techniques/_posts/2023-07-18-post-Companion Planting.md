	<p>Companion planting is the practice of growing different species of plants together to have them benefit off each other. Having a variety of plants grown together is called polyculture, and it is a more resilient method of cultivation compared to traditional monoculture, which features garden beds that only grow one kind of crop.</p>

	<p>There are many ways to companion plant, but the most common are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Growing pollinator-attracting plants with fruiting vegetables to increase fruit set</li>
		<li>Growing legumes to fix nitrogen in the soil, making the soil more fertile for the growing of nitrogen-heavy feeders like leafy vegetables</li>
		<li>Growing groundcovers to act as a living mulch to keep the soil cool and suppress weeds</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Growing pollinator-attracting plants</h4>

	<p>Many crops like Tomatoes, Brinjals, Cucumbers and Long Beans need pollinators to form fruit. Providing nectar-rich flowers throughout the year in your garden will attract bees, butterflies, and birds to your garden, and ensure that your plants produce plenty of fruit. These flowering plants can be arranged as a border in your plot as part of perimeter planting or in between your crops.</p>
	<p>Some common pollinator-attracting plants include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Brazilian Tea</li>
		<li>False Heather</li>
		<li>Golden Dewdrops</li>
		<li>Sunflowers</li>
		<li>Thai Basil</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Growing legumes to fix nitrogen</h4>

	<p>Legumes like Long Beans, Winged Beans, and Peanuts will fix nitrogen into the soil via their root nodules. Nitrogen is a key chemical needed for plant growth, so having a few legumes near nitrogen heavy feeders like Kailan, Lettuce and other leafy vegetables will encourage these crops to grow more leaves and increase their yield. Legumes are used in a similar way in crop rotation to improve soil fertility of annual crop beds.  </p>
	<p>Some legumes used for companion planting include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Butterfly Pea</li>
		<li>Peanuts</li>
		<li>Winged Bean</li>
		<li>Long bean</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Growing groundcovers as a living mulch</h4>
	<img src="/images/Hardscapes/PXL_20230225_024644403.jpg" title="Alternanthera plants being used as living mulch. Photo by Jacqueline Chua">
	<p>Covering the soil with organic or inorganic mulches helps to reduce water loss, suppress weeds, and prevent soil erosion. Some groundcovers that have fast-growing vines that cover the soil can be used as a living mulch and pairing them with taller plants like Ladyâ€™s-Fingers, or Brinjals as a main crop is a good way to maximize yields while keeping the soil healthy.</p>  
	<p>However, living mulches still need water and nutrients, and thus need more watering, maintenance and fertilizing compared to non-living mulches to keep both the living mulch and the main crop productive.</p> 
	<p>Some edible living mulches include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Cucumber (<em>Cucumis sativus</em>)</li>
		<li>Kang Kong (<em>Ipomoea aquatica</em>)</li>
		<li>Mexican Sedum (<em>Sedum mexicanum</em>)</li>
		<li>Mother of Thousands (<em>Kalanchoe daigremontiana</em>)</li>
		<li>Sand ginger (<em>Kaempferia galanga</em>)</li>
		<li>Sissoo Spinach (<em>Alternanthera sissoo</em>)</li>
		<li>Spearmint (<em>Mentha spicata</em>)</li>
		<li>Sweet potato (<em>Ipomoea batatas</em>)</li>
		<li>Turmeric (<em>Curcuma longa</em>)</li>
	</ul>
