<p>Companion planting is the practice of growing different species of plants together to have them benefit off each other. Having a variety of plants grown together is called polyculture, and it is a more resilient method of cultivation compared to traditional monoculture, which features garden beds that only grow one kind of crop.</p>

<p>There are many ways to companion plant, but the most common are:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Growing pollinator-attracting plants with fruiting vegetables to increase fruit set</li>
  <li>Growing legumes to fix nitrogen in the soil, making the soil more fertile for the growing of nitrogen-heavy feeders like leafy vegetables</li>
  <li>Growing groundcovers to act as a living mulch to keep the soil cool and suppress weeds</li>
</ul>

<h4>Growing pollinator-attracting plants</h4>

<p>Legumes like Long Beans, Winged Beans, and Peanuts will fix nitrogen into the soil via their root nodules. Nitrogen is a key chemical needed for plant growth, so having a few legumes near nitrogen heavy feeders like Kailan, Lettuce and other leafy vegetables will encourage these crops to grow more leaves and increase their yield. Legumes are used in a similar way in crop rotation to improve soil fertility of annual crop beds.  </p>

<h4>Growing groundcovers as a living mulch</h4>

<p>Covering the soil with organic or inorganic mulches helps to reduce water loss, suppress weeds, and prevent soil erosion. Some groundcovers that have fast-growing vines that cover the soil can be used as a living mulch and pairing them with taller plants like Ladyâ€™s-Fingers, or Brinjals as a main crop is a good way to maximize yields while keeping the soil healthy. </p>  
<p>However, living mulches still need water and nutrients, and thus need more watering, maintenance and fertilizing compared to non-living mulches to keep both the living mulch and the main crop productive.</p> 
<p>Some edible living mulches include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cucumber (<em>Cucumis sativus</em>)</li>
  <li>Kang Kong (<em>Ipomoea aquatica</em>)</li>
  <li>Mexican Sedum (<em>Sedum mexicanum</em>)</li>
  <li>Mother of Thousands (<em>Kalanchoe daigremontiana</em>)</li>
  <li>Sand ginger (<em>Kaempferia galanga</em>)</li>
  <li>Sissoo Spinach (<em>Alternanthera sissoo</em>)</li>
  <li>Spearmint (<em>Mentha spicata</em>)</li>
  <li>Sweet potato (<em>Ipomoea batatas</em>)</li>
  <li>Turmeric (<em>Curcuma longa</em>)</li>
