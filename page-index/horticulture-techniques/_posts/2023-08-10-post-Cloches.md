<p>Cloche is a French word that means ‘bell’, with traditional cloches being bell-shaped and made of glass or sturdy, transparent plastic. Today, there are many forms of cloches, each catering to specific needs of different plants and gardens. </p>
<p>Cloches are like little greenhouses, providing protection to seedlings and young plants from strong winds, pests, and heavy rain. Cloches are generally meant to protect seeds or seedlings and will need to be removed or modified as the plant outgrows it. Seedlings that have soft stems and leaves benefit greatly from being grown in cloches. </p>
<p>In temperate countries, cloches are usually used to warm the soil and protect plants from frost. In hot, tropical countries like Singapore however, these warming properties are more likely to kill your plant rather than help it! This can be solved by providing ventilation holes to prevent mildew and fungi from attacking your plants, and to keep the plant cool during the heat of the day. The holes should not be larger than 5cm in diameter to prevent pests like snails from crawling in and eating your plants. Alternatively, the cloche can be made from wire mesh or netting to provide protection while keeping your plants well-ventilated. </p>

<h4>Cloche designs and materials</h4>
<p>Cloches are typically made from materials that let in light, like clear plastic, wire mesh, or white netting. Here are some examples to get you started:</p>

<p>Halved clear plastic bottles are great for small to medium-sized seedlings, with the top coming with a ready-made ventilation hole. You can poke holes in the plastic with a nail or a hot skewer to provide additional ventilation. Take note that this type of cloche can encourage the growth of mildew, fungi or mould if it does not have enough ventilation! Plants that do well with plastic bottle cloches include cucumbers and pumpkins. </p>

<p>Wire mesh can be bent into a bell or basket shape to protect seedlings. Wire mesh is easy to modify and can be quickly adjusted into a cage stake for larger plants like tomatoes to rest on. Mesh will automatically have plenty of ventilation and stop large pests like birds or rodents, but mesh with large holes may not protect seedlings from heavy rain or smaller pests like young grasshoppers. Use fine mesh for better protection.</p>

<p>White netting provides even better protection than wire mesh, but because it needs to be supported with stakes or other structures, it tends to be much larger. The netting is usually made into a tunnel or box shape to cover the entire planting bed rather than the bell shape that is traditional for cloches. This type of cloche can also be kept permanently over beds for small plants. This type of cloche is best for large numbers of small seedlings, like Xiao Bai Cai, Kai Lan or Cai Xin.</p>
