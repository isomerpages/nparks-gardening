	<p>Growing plants from seeds is an important skill to master for any gardener as home-grown seedlings can be cheaper and healthier than plants sold in nurseries. Seeds can be obtained from our local nurseries or supermarkets, or even harvested from your own plants!</p>

	<p>Seed packets come with for useful information on growing plants, including:</p>
	<ul>

	</ul>
	<img src="/images/Horti%20techniques/SproutingSeeds_Jacchua.jpg">
	<p>Seeds should be used as soon as they are bought or harvested as germination rates will decrease over time. Unused seeds should be stored in air-tight containers, and placed in cool, dry areas such as a refrigerator to extend its shelf life.</p>

	<p>Seedlings and seeds are vulnerable to pathogens and disease. They are also prone to rot if they are left sitting in water for too long. You can make your own well-draining seed-starting mix with sterile <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">soil amendments</a>. Pure cocopeat, pure perlite, or an equal mix of cocopeat and perlite are good mixes for starting seeds.</p>

	<p>Sowing seeds individually in seed trays or pots is a good practice as seedlings will not compete, and it is easier to observe which seedlings are stronger and therefore easier to grow.</p>

	<p>Seedling trays or pots can be filled with sterile seed-starting mixes, which prevents pathogens like fungi and bacteria from killing vulnerable seedlings. The trays or pots can also be kept in a sheltered propagation area to keep seedlings away from <a href="/page-index/pests/pests/">pests</a> and harsh weather.</p>

	<p>Seedling trays are for smaller plants and smaller seeds, while seedling pots are for larger plants with larger seeds. For example, <a href="/page-index/edible-plants/tomato/">tomatoes</a> do well in seedling trays as their seeds are only a few millimeters across and have sprouts that are less than 5cm high, while pumpkins have large seeds up to 1.5cm across and sprouts that can quickly reach 10cm in height in a few days. A good rule of thumb is that seeds less than 0.5cm can be started in seedling trays, while seeds larger than 0.5cm can be started in seedling pots.</p>
		<p>Here is how you can start seedlings in trays and pots:</p>
	<img title="Seedlings in a seedling tray. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Horti%20techniques/SeedlingTray_Jacchua%20(7).jpg">
		<ol>
				 <li>Get a seedling tray or seedling pots. Seedling trays and pots should allow water to drain out. You can buy a commercial seedling tray, or make your own using a cardboard or plastic egg tray with holes poked at the bottom. Seedling pots can be made out of toilet paper rolls, or small plastic pots no deeper than 10cm.</li>
		 <li>Fill the seedling tray or pot with potting or seed-starting mix. Ensure that you use new sterile soil or soil amendments to minimize chances of fungi and bacteria from killing your seedlings.</li>
		 <li>Sprinkle 2-3 seeds into each cell or pot evenly.</li>
		 <li>Cover the seedlings with a thin layer of potting or seed-starting mix.</li>
		 <li>Water the soil thoroughly with a fine spray.</li>
		 <li>If more than one seed sprouts per cell or pot, remove the less healthy seedlings to leave one seedling per cell. </li>
		</ol>

	<p>It is important to transplant seedlings when they have 4-8 leaves, as young seedlings may not survive the transplanting shock of being moved into a <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">bigger pot</a> or <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a>, while seedlings that are too old will be stunted as the seedlings may be <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/root-bound/">root-bound</a>. Transplanted seedlings can also be <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/plant-spacing/">regularly spaced or used to fill gaps</a>, maximising the growing area.</p>
	<p>Here are the steps for transplanting seedlings:</p>
	<ol>
		<img title="A gardener preparing a large pot for transplanting tomato seedlings. Photo by NParks." src="/images/Horti%20techniques/Soil_Mixing_JacChua.jpg">
		 <li>When the seedlings are about 5-10cm tall, or with 2-3 sets of secondary leaves, they are ready for transplanting into true ground, planter beds or larger pots. Make sure that the new planting area is large enough with the appropriate soil depth for the fully-grown plant. Prepare the planting area with the appropriate soil, and remove weeds, large stones, and other debris as needed.</li>

			 <li>Gently remove the seedling from the seedling tray or pot with roots and seed-starting mix attached.</li>
		<img title="Tomato seedlings with plenty of white, healthy roots. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Horti%20techniques/transplants_tomato%20(2)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
		 <li>Check the roots of your seedlings. Healthy roots are white, and should be growing throughout your seedling medium. Throw unhealthy or rotting seedlings away, or into your <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/composting/">compost</a>. </li>
		<img title="A gardener digging a hole in the larger pot to plant a tomato seedling. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Horti%20techniques/transplants_tomato%20(3)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
		<li>Dig a hole in the soil deep enough to cover the roots of your seedling, roughly the same depth as your seedling tray or pot.</li>
					<img title="A gardener gently pushing down on the soil around a seedling to keep it upright. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Horti%20techniques/transplants_tomato%20(1)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
		 <li>Plant the seedling in the soil. The soil should cover all the roots, but should not be higher up the plant from when it was growing in the seedling tray or pot. </li>
		<img title="Watering seedlings daily after transplanting. Photo by Jacqueline Chua." src="/images/Horti%20techniques/watering%20(1)_jacquelinechua.jpg">
		<li>Water your seedlings immediately after transplanting, and daily for at least a week to help them recover from <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/transplanting-shock">transplanting shock</a>. Freshly transplanted seedlings should be protected with <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">shade netting</a> or kept in a shaded area with at least <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/gauging-light/">4 hours of indirect sunlight</a> for a week while they recover, and then exposed to full sunlight to grow to full size.</li> 
	</ol>
	<p>This method of sowing seeds is particularly good for the following plants:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/page-index/edible-plants/cai-xin/">Cai Xin</a> (<em>Brassica rapa</em> Caisin Group)</li>
		<li><a href="/page-index/edible-plants/chinese-mustard/">Chinese Mustard</a> (<em>Brassica juncea Broad-leaf Mustard</em>)</li>

	<p>Seeds sown directly into <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/planting-in-containers/">bigger pots</a>, <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/true-ground/">true ground</a> or wherever they are meant to grow permanently will grow quickly and will not suffer from <a href="/page-index/plant-problems/transplanting-shock">transplanting shock</a> like seedlings in seed trays or pots. This also a good way for growing plants with large seeds bigger than 0.5cm as these seedlings often get constricted by small seedling trays. It is also a good way to grow plants that can grow in tight clusters or as a ground cover.  However, seedlings sown this way will have to compete with weeds, and are vulnerable to pests like <a href="/page-index/pests/snails-and-slugs/">snails and slugs</a>, harsh sun, and heavy rain. These seedlings may need to be protected with <a href="/page-index/hardscapes/netting/">netting</a> or a <a href="/page-index/horticulture-techniques/cloches/">cloche</a> to survive. The large amount of unsterilised soil also exposes seedlings to pathogens like fungi or bacteria, which can kill them.</p>

	<p>How to sow seeds directly:</p>
	<ol>
		 <li>Fill your planting area with soil appropriate for your plant</li>
		 <li>Make a shallow groove in the soil along the length of your planting space.</li>
		 <li>Sprinkle small seeds or space out large seeds into the groove evenly</li>
		 <li>Fill the groove with sterile potting or seedling mix.</li>
		 <li>Water the soil thoroughly with a fine spray.</li>
		 <li>After sowing, install a netting or cloche over the bed to protect the seedlings from rain and pests.</li>
		 <li>Thin seedlings according to their final planting space when they have 4 or more leaves. </li>
	</ol>
