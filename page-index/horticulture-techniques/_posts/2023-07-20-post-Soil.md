<p>Soil is a key component of the garden that supplies essential nutrients, water, oxygen and root support for plants to grow and flourish. Soil comes in a variety of types and textures, and different plants will thrive in different soils. Knowing what your soil is made of and tailoring it to your plants needs is an important part of being a successful gardener. </p>

<h4>What is soil?</h4>
<p>Soil is made up of mineral particles, organic matter, water, and air. The three main components gardeners are usually concerned with are sand, clay and organic matter.
</p>

	<p>Sand has the largest particles at around 0.05 – 2 mm in diameter. The large particles allow water and important nutrients to move through easily. Because of this, sandy soil tends to dry out quickly and needs to be watered more frequently.</p>

<p>Clay has the smallest particles, usually less than 0.002 mm in diameter. Clayey soil retains water and nutrients well due to its tiny, dense particles. However, clayey soil also drains slowly and can become hard and compacted when dry.</p>

<p>Organic matter is material produced by living organisms and broken down through decomposition by microorganisms. Some common organic materials include compost and cocopeat. Organic matter can absorb and hold water while letting the rest drain away, making it ideal for keeping roots hydrated. However, it needs to be replenished after being broken down, and it does not inherently hold nutrients. </p>

<h4>Soil texture and type</h4>

<p>The proportion of sand, organic matter and clay particles will determine the soil texture and type. The proportion will also determine the physical properties such as drainage rate and capacity to hold nutrients. Below are some soil types which can be found in gardens in Singapore.</p>

<p>Sandy soils are low in nutrients and water holding capacity but tend to be very airy. They have a gritty feel or rough texture with varying hard particle sizes. Succulents and drought-tolerant plants grow well in sandy soil. It is important to use horticultural or river sand for sandy soils as sand from the sea tends to be salty, while construction or playground sand tends to be very fine. If the sand particles are too fine, they can become compacted and dense like clay, preventing roots from growing well. Sandy soils are often sold as ‘cactus mix’.</p>

<p>Clayey soils are dense and heavy soils which do not drain well or provide space for plant roots to establish. On hot days, they become hard and dry, and become sticky when wet. They have greater capacity to hold nutrients. They also tend to be waterlogged because water is not able to drain away easily, which tends to lead to root rot for a lot of plants. Some native plants can tolerate and grow well in this kind of difficult soil. Most untreated true ground soils are clayey and will need soil amendments to improve it. Clayey soils are generally not sold commercially, although sometimes cheap and poor-quality topsoil can turn out to be clayey. </p>
	<img title="A plant growing in loamy soil, which is a mix of clay, sand, and organic matter. Photo by Jacqueline Chua" src="/images/Horti%20techniques/Soil_Jacchua%20(3).jpg">
<p>Loamy soils are a good mixture of clay, sand and organic matter. They are the ideal soil type for most plants as they are soft enough for roots to grow well, for water to drain easily, and have enough nutrients to support plant growth. Most nurseries will sell loamy soil as ‘potting’ or ‘vegetable mix’. Edible plants usually require loamy soil to flourish.</p>
<p>You can also figure out your soil type by using the Mason Jar Soil Test, in which water and dish soap is used to separate soil into its main components. </p>
<img title="The soil mason jar test. Image by NParks" src="/images/Horti%20techniques/soilmasonjartest_nparks.png">
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collect enough soil to fill one-third of the jar.</li>
<li>Remove any pebbles, debris, rocks and large organic matter (such as leaves, sticks or roots) from the soil. If possible, sift the soil using a sieve or old colander.</li>
<li>Crush any lumps of soil.</li>
<li>Place the soil in the jar and fill the remaining two-thirds with tap water.</li>
<li>Add about 1 teaspoon of liquid dish soap.</li>
<li>Secure the lid and shake the jar for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Set the jar in a place where it can sit undisturbed for 24 hours.</li>
<li>After 24 hours, the contents would have settled into distinct layers. The heaviest material is sand which will sink to the bottom. This will be followed by silt and lastly clay at the very top.</li>
<li>Using a ruler, measure the height of each layer and the total height of all 3 layers to calculate the percentage of clay, silt and sand.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Mixing your own soil</h4>
	<img title="A gardener mixing soil in a pot" src="/images/Horti%20techniques/Soil_Mixing_JacChua.jpg">
<p>Using sand, clay, and organic matter, you can mix your own soil to grow a wide range of plants. For standardization, sand here refers to the horticultural sand that can be purchased at nurseries, clay refers to raw clay from the ground or burnt earth, and organic matter refers to mature compost. </p>
<p>Some suggested recipes are below:</p>
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Soil components/ Soil type</th>
			<th>Sand</th>
			<th>Clay</th>
                        <th>Organic matter</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
	  	<th>Sandy</th>
			 <td>3 parts</td>
			 <td>1 part</td>
			 <td>1 part</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Clayey</th>
			<td></td>
			<td>3 parts</td>
			<td>1 part</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Loamy</th>
			<td>1 part</td>
			<td>1 part</td>
			<td>1-2 parts</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>These soil mixes can be supplemented with <a href="https://staging.dmhtu0pi4p9u7.amplifyapp.com/page-index/horticulture-techniques/soil-amendments/">soil amendments</a> to improve specific soil aspects, or to replace the sand, clay or organic matter components as needed.</p></section>
